0,"Not Verified |   Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
1,"✅ Trip Verified | Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
2,"✅ Trip Verified | This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
3,"✅ Trip Verified |  While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
4,"✅ Trip Verified | British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
5,"✅ Trip Verified |  Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
6,"Not Verified |   We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight "
7,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
8,✅ Trip Verified |  A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
9,"✅ Trip Verified | The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
10,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
11,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
12,"✅ Trip Verified |  BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
13,"✅ Trip Verified | I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA. "
14,"✅ Trip Verified | My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
15,"Not Verified |  We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
16,"✅ Trip Verified |  I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
17,"✅ Trip Verified | We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
18,"✅ Trip Verified | I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
19,✅ Trip Verified | It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
20,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead. "
21,"✅ Trip Verified |  A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
22,✅ Trip Verified |  Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines. 
23,"✅ Trip Verified | Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
24,"✅ Trip Verified |  LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
25,Not Verified |   I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
26,"✅ Trip Verified |  Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
27,"✅ Trip Verified |  BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
28,"✅ Trip Verified |   I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible. "
29,"✅ Trip Verified |  Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
30,✅ Trip Verified |  I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
31,"✅ Trip Verified |  Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view. "
32,"✅ Trip Verified |  Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
33,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually! "
34,"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
35,"✅ Trip Verified |  We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
36,"✅ Trip Verified | The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
37,Not Verified |   British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
38,"Not Verified | I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
39,"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
40,"✅ Trip Verified |  This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
41,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
42,"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
43,"Not Verified |  We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
44,"✅ Trip Verified | A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
45,"✅ Trip Verified |   Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
46,"Not Verified |  LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
47,"Not Verified |  Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
48,✅ Trip Verified | Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
49,"Not Verified |  The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
50,"✅ Trip Verified |  We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
51,"✅ Trip Verified |  Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
52,"Not Verified |   Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
53,"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
54,"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
55,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
56,"Not Verified |  BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
57,"✅ Trip Verified |  BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
58,"✅ Trip Verified |  The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
59,"Not Verified |  Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
60,"Not Verified |  I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back. "
61,"✅ Trip Verified |  On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
62,"✅ Trip Verified |  I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
63,"✅ Trip Verified |  I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
64,"✅ Trip Verified |  Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
65,"✅ Trip Verified | Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
66,✅ Trip Verified |  That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
67,✅ Trip Verified |  Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
68,"Not Verified |  We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
69,"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
70,"Not Verified | Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
71,"✅ Trip Verified | I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
72,"Not Verified |  Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
73,"✅ Trip Verified | On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
74,"Not Verified | I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels. "
75,"✅ Trip Verified | We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
76,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
77,"✅ Trip Verified |  I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
78,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
79,"✅ Trip Verified | Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked. "
80,✅ Trip Verified | Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
81,"✅ Trip Verified |  BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
82,"✅ Trip Verified | Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
83,"Not Verified | I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
84,"Not Verified |  I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
85,"Not Verified | Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid. "
86,✅ Trip Verified |  The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
87,"Not Verified | Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
88,"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
89,"✅ Trip Verified |  As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food! "
90,✅ Trip Verified |  First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
91,"Not Verified |  Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
92,"✅ Trip Verified |  My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company. "
93,"✅ Trip Verified |  For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
94,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
95,"✅ Trip Verified |  Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
96,"Not Verified | This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
97,"✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
98,"Not Verified |  Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
99,"✅ Trip Verified | This was our first flight with British Airways in over 13 years and as usual I couldn’t fault them. As we were connecting, we had little interaction with ground staff - staff in the lounge were friendly and helpful. Cabin crew on the flight were great - very welcoming and friendly. Our meals were delicious & no shortage of drinks being offered. The seats were economy seats with the middle row blocked off and some recline. We arrived into Stockholm a little early through a snow shower which was a nice welcome back to Stockholm. Bags (checked in at JFK) were delivered safely within 20 mins of arriving."
100,✅ Trip Verified |  We arrived 3 and half hours before our flight the queues to BA was terrible. The airport security lines were not managed well. The gate was closing as we arrived after jogging to the gate (with asthma). It was by far the worst travelling experience i have ever had that i have experienced. All the airlines should put out a warning that you should arrive at least 4 hours before to have an enjoyable experience. Amsterdam is the worst airport I have experienced. 
101,"✅ Trip Verified |  BA says that tickets are flexible and cancellation is free within 24 hrs. That reality is an absolutely miserable alternative. 8 hours after booking, I need to change my flight. I assume I will get a refund like their site says I will - that was apparently a lie. They actually give me a voucher. To request the voucher I have to sign away that I agree to the voucher despite not knowing how much money they will refund me and I might not get it for a week.  I am panicked so I try calling them. Of course, calling them does nothing. The hotline says that they are too busy. This happens again and again. So, I give up, submit the request online despite no guarantee of amount or timing. Luckily it shows up quickly, and I rebook. Then I need to change my booking again. I go to request a voucher again. This time the voucher code doesn't work on the website when I enter it. So here I am needing to rebook with a useless voucher. Finally I call the executive class phone line (which I am not a member of) and then eventually pick up and agree to help me. They do some thing on their back end and tell me that they will send the information to their booking department who will contact me in 72 hours."
102,"Not Verified |  I have been battling a long overdue refund with BA regarding a flight originally booked in 2019... The flight was cancelled, a voucher was issued, another flight was booked using this voucher, and then again cancelled. After trying to use the voucher for a new flight, BA kept advising I couldn't as the voucher had been used. I asked them to check the status of that flight (as it never left) and the agent advised she didn't have access to that information. Two years in, I managed to speak to someone who recognised that either a voucher or refund was due and made a note on my record. I then decided to pursue a refund, as felt this would be less problematic. BA have acknowledged they owe me a refund. One phone call they said it will be with me in 18 working days. I then chased when it was long overdue. I was then told it will be with me in 21 working days. The refund never came. I try regularly to get through to Customer Service for the automated system to advise no agents are available. I have also sent two follow up messages via the case reference link they sent me, requesting an update, but with no response. Honestly feel very let down by BA who up until this, I felt were the more trustworthy and reliable airline. I suspect they will have ruined many trusted relationships with customers by now."
103,"✅ Trip Verified |  When I tried to check in, they required a certificate of insurance for Covid travel, but I did not have it, I tried for over 2 hours to get it issued, but my bank (where I had the travel insurance) the department that could issue the certificate was closed, it was 18:30. After a very long time, I got a cover letter which the bank sent to me, but then to be told I had missed the check in by 2 minutes. They would not let me board, and I missed the flight. So I contacted BA, and tried to rebook another departure flight, only to be told that because I missed my departing flight, my return flight had automatically been cancelled and this was BA policy. So then they worked out a new price to book the flights, but now the price was £3500. I originally paid £1500 for the flights. I then did a search on Google and found flights for £1100, flying out with Air Mauritius and returning with BA on the same flight I was originally supposed to return on. Unfortunately BA had made me miss 2 days of my holiday, I searched for over an hour but could not find anywhere on BA site that I needed the Insurance document. When I checked in for the Mauritius airways flight, they did not ask for the insurance document, and I had a lovely flight with no issues. Every time I fly with BA, I have a bad experience and I promise I will never fly with them again. "
104,✅ Trip Verified |  Another dreadful mediocre experience with BA to Malaga. This time boarding was by bus and to a remote stand with no Aircon. Then on flight the the Wi-Fi was erratic and guests couldn’t order food or drinks. Then the card payment system didn’t work so we gave up on ordering. Finally at Malaga we were held up and not allowed to leave the plane as the bags had to come off first in case 'we' caused the plane to go unbalanced? Really? It’s all one excuse after another with BA these days.
105,"Not Verified | Basel to Johannesburg via London. Cancelled connection flight: confusing UI, still shows cancelled booking in my bookings, never sent a confirmation email for new flights.  Cant check-in. Could check-in online or via the app. Customer service is non-existent. Busy line, after 45min still no one there to help me check in."
106,"✅ Trip Verified |  Very low standards for Club Europe: there was no cabin divider in the aircraft, so no privacy or separate cabin as would be expected, aircraft not properly cleaned in Athens (there was full rubbish bag left in the seat pocket). No in-flight information as the in flight maps have long disappeared from European routes which is a shame. Staff was attentive though and tried their best."
107,"✅ Trip Verified |  This flight was not affected by recent problems with BA and I was quite impressed by the British Airways Premium Economy product in a new Boeing 787. Overall, Premium Economy turned out to be premium and clearly a step up from Economy towards Business Class. Also, the Premium Economy product came across much better in the Boeing 787 than in the old B747 or even than in the B777. Seat was very comfortable and had nice leg room. Food, service and entertainment options were good. Clearly worth the extra money for Premium Economy."
108,"Not Verified |  British Airways continues to decline in customer service. I used to love this airline and now I have had three poor experiences back to back regarding their customer service on the phone with flight changes and vouchers. The most recent experience has cost me $3000 more than originally booked due to bad rep advice and multiple calls to the company. Even as part of the Executive Club (Silver) I continue to be left on hold for ages and in the last week have spent over 6 hours on the phone seeking support. At this rate, they have lost my trust."
109,"Not Verified |  On my flight from LAX to LHR I paid to pick my seat for my flight back to LAX. I saw the $116 come out of my account the next day. As I’m adding in my booking the day before my flight, the website tells me I no longer have a booked seat and the seat I paid for has been sold to someone else. I spent an hour trying to find a way to contact their customer service and at first was told to DM the airline on Twitter which I find extremely inappropriate but I still reached out anyway because I was unable to find another way to contact them. On Twitter, I was told they were looking for an agent to help me and they never ended up responding. They just left my message unread. After about 6 hours of waiting for a Twitter DM back I ended up being able to find a chat line on their website. While talking to the agent on the chat line she informed me that they sold my seat to another customer and that she would book me a new seat, however she was unable to tell me where the seat was or how many people were in my row. After a frustrating conversation she was able to book me my original seat. Soon after I tried to pull up my booking in the British Airways app and was unable to find it. I would enter the booking reference and the site would say it was a success and the booking would show up once I refreshed the page but it did not. I continued to try and add the booking and the app would do the same thing every time, say it was a success then never add the booking. I’m not able to find the chat line again and I will not DM a company on Twitter with my support issues again. I’m extremely frustrated."
110,"✅ Trip Verified | Amazing flight and comfortable. The premium economy seats have been upgraded with a leg rest. New aircraft. Staff very friendly and professional. The food was great, beyond expectation."
111,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a flight to London and paid, months in advance, to upgrade my seat to an isle side exit row (front of the cabin + more legroom). Upon check-in, my expensive upgrade had been given away to someone else, and I was left to choose a miserable middle seat near the toilet. I spent an entire afternoon calling customer service. If my call went through at all (the automated system simply hangs up when it decides they are too busy) I was placed on indefinite hold, replete with elevator music and an insincere guarantee that my call mattered. I was greeted by someone with a heavy accent, over a very low quality, hard to hear line (I am 32 and not deaf). Sometimes, they would purposely hang up before I said anything. Other times, they would purposely hang up after I stated my plight. IF I managed to persist through all of that, for hours on end, they would hang up purposely after ""needing"" to put me on hold once more to ""speak with their supervisor."" In the end, BA managed to swindle me for hundreds of dollars, and I booked with another airline on principle. "
112,"Not Verified |  We are on our way home after a 3 week holiday in the UK and have had all 4 flights with British Airways. Our 2 internal flights between London and Edinburgh were great due to the friendly staff and there were no complications, however, the 2 long haul flights have been a nightmare. Our initial flight from Cape Town to Heathrow was a full flight, the staff seemed very overwhelmed, they ran out of certain food and drinks and as we were in economy right at the back we got the ""leftovers"", my entertainment system was also not working. We are about to board the return flight from Heathrow to Cape Town and the check in process was horrific. I had booked through Expedia and somehow my return flight did not have a checked in bag allowance which I didn't realise until we checked in. I ended up having to pay an additional £85 for my bag, after being told to try do it under manage my booking on the app which was not possible and I also spent 20 minutes on hold trying to get through to the BA customer service number with no luck. We asked to speak to someone is person in terminal 5 and were told that they have no customer service desk in the main BA terminal.  Overall it took us about 2 hours to get me checked in after speaking to about 6 different staff members, none of which could help me. There was also a discrepancy with the baggage allowance as my friend I am traveling with was allowed 26kg and after paying to add my bag I was told it was overweight as I was only allowed 23kg and the bag was 24kg. Compared to having flown with other airlines I will never fly with BA again, the level of service is shocking compared to what you would expect."
113,✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to thank you for the great service. I am a handicap and my family and I were afraid of this trip because I was flying alone and had a layover in London of a few hours. I had to change terminals and everything but thanks to a great service my trip was amazing. They took great care of me and made sure I was doing well throughout the whole flight.
114,"✅ Trip Verified | I connected into Madrid on Iberia and wrote a scathing review of their awful long haul business class service. British Airways short haul business class was in a totally different class. The cabin had 10 rows of seats in BC, a record for me. The staff met us at the door in a very cheerful way and this was a sign of the highly professional way they would continue to look after us throughout the flight. The messaging from cabin crew and flight crew was excellent. The food was first class, nothing was too much for the staff. Why, oh why can two members of the same company offer such different levels of sift and hard service? My thought is that it must be ingrained in the ethics of the company. British Airways keep up the good work, (it would be better if you had proper business class seats like some of your European competitors) overall you made me feel proud to be a Brit."
115,"Not Verified |  We flew from Dubrovnik to Heathrow on the 24th April 2022. Check in was very fast and we cleared security in about 15 minute, we made our way up to the lounge which just has the basic essentials but was clean and spacious. When boarding time came we had priority boarding and was the first few to board, welcomed by the cabin crew and given wipes, once seated we left more or less on tme had the safety brief taxiing for take off. Once airborne it was soon time for the drinks and meal services, choice of 3 main meal options which was very good, served by very friendly crew, the captain kept us informed about the progress of the journey arrived at Heathrow slightly early. Overall a very pleasant trip. We will be flying again with British Airways"
116,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have always chosen to not make a big deal of the poor service, delays, dirty aircraft, over packed lounges, cabin crew etc experienced over the years but have lost all patience with this airline. Having paid almost £1K extra to change our return flight for the family, to get a flight at a specific time, BA cancelled this and placed us on another flight almost 10 hours later. There was no option to get any of the other available flights. The business class lounge at LHR was packed with hardly any space to move. The aircraft was filthy with food wrapping papers on my seat and floor. The seats were uncomfortable. Food for business class passengers included bread rolls passed in a basket. The poor level of hygiene, overcrowding, delays, cancellations makes this the worst airline I have had to endure. "
117,"✅ Trip Verified | Business lounge was closed at Pisa airport which was probably beyond the control of British Airways but as it had been closed since January the least British Airways could have done would have issued their customers who paid for this service vouchers to be used at the airport, I complained about this to BA and as compensation they said they would credit my account with 10000 Avios points which I felt was an adequate compensation and at that point felt BA had handled the situation in a prompt and professional manner. However that was seven weeks ago and no Avios points have been added to my account, I have called their call centre multiple times at one point being put on hold for an hour to put through to the right department, when the phone was answered I was told it was the wrong department and to phone a number which was read out to me which was the same number I was calling! This scenario has replayed itself probably about twenty times now, it is clear that BA have no intention of resolving this and are just making their customer go round in circles before they give up, This airline is absolutely appalling in the way it treats its customers."
118,"Not Verified |  Our Good Friday flight was delayed by 5hours, STD 12.50 ATD 18.00 TO Durban, South Africa from Johannesburg. There were no announcements made, when approached no time frame was given, they simply didn't know. An aircraft had to be towed from a hanger at Johannesburg. Crew arrived late. The aircraft was filthy. We shall never fly Comair again that includes Kulula or BA absolutely shocking service."
119,Not Verified |  We had a trip with 4 flights included. All 4 flights were delayed. The worst with 2h15min. Also one flight was cancelled and we were rebooked to a 4h earlier flight loosing 4h of our short vacation. No explanation or compensation was given for the cancelled flights or delays. I expected a lot better as I have earlier used BA with good results. This was a really bad experience and I will avoid using BA for any further travels.
120,"Not Verified |  My first time in the new Club World suite. Excellent, lots of space and privacy, very good seat. I doubt if this can be bettered. Good staff as ever. My only quibble is that the food is all served at once. BA needs to roll this out quickly!"
121,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had an Incredible rude check in staff at the British Airways counter in Nice on 16th April 2022. Zero empathy towards me a struggling customer. Second situation happened when we arrived into Nice Terminal 1 on BA0262 13 April where my luggage did not make it on the same flight as me and had to put my details down for delivery. When our luggage arrived at Nice airport the day after and received an email from the AVIA Partner lost and found (British Airways Partner) at 13:14PM informing us that our luggage has now arrived in Nice. After multiple emails back and forth with emphasis on we were strongly expressing that I did not have clothes or shoes to wear and that we only had 3 short days in Monaco, it was vital we received the luggage ASAP, the lady replied “If it is so important why don’t you come and pick it up here at the airport or send your driver to pick it up” despite the fact that a proper delivery address was supplied to them from the very beginning. This has been an appalling experience."
122,"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked a business class flight with Qantas from Melbourne to Glasgow via London. As Qantas fly to Heathrow, British Airways is their partner airline so we were automatically booked on BA from Heathrow to Glasgow. We booked this flight in October however 2 days before we were due to leave, we received an email from British Airways, advising that our flight from Heathrow to Glasgow has been cancelled. To help us out the email said, they had however booked us on another flight leaving from London City Airport, which is 26 miles from Heathrow Airport and the flight is going to Edinburgh, not Glasgow. Not sure how we were supposed to get from Glasgow, additionally it is in economy, not business class even though we had booked business class originally. We booked this as one connecting flight so British Airways know that we have just travelled 22 hours from Australia. There was no mention in the email about compensation for the change of class or additional travel costs in getting to another airport, nothing about possibly not accepting the flight given it was obviously never going to work for us and no contact details for British Airways. They also sent the email on Good Friday so even when I did eventually find a contact number, their office was closed. I have never experienced such terrible customer service with any airline I have ever flow on and I can guarantee I will never fly British Airways again. "
123,"Not Verified |  The service was very good, the cabin crew were very kind and the boarding was very quick for an aircraft of this size. The seat was comfortable for economy and because the A380 walls are still expanding outwards on the first floor, there was a lot of space. The food was good for airplane food. The only bad thing was the ife screen was quite outdated and wasn't good quality, however there was a large selection of movies and TV shows"
124,"✅ Trip Verified |  Total chaos for departures immigration at Malaga Airport. Boarding was quick, polite welcome by cabin crew. Beverage cart after take off was prompt, followed by lunch with a choice of 3 entrees. Food can best be described as wholesome, but not meeting quality levels of Air France, Swiss or Lufthansa short haul business class meals. Menu is still missing, and like many other aspects of the experience, BA cut a lot during Covid and have not reintroduced. I wouldn't mind, but on European trips in 2022, BA are charging up to 3 times the fare levels of 2019, and the overall value for money is now very poor. The WiFi did not work from start to finish of the flight. Crew said it had worked on the way out and the Captain had contacted London to get it fixed on the return. BA is becoming more and more shambolic, blaming far too much on Covid and it is time they took some responsibility for their failings.
"
125,"Not Verified |  Shout out to the help desk at Heathrow, we arrived to late to make our flight and the lady (with 32 years exp) was great, she had a tough crowd to deal with and was very kind and helpful in getting us a place to stay, food to eat and a flight home the next day."
126,"Not Verified |  I am constantly amazed how British Airways continue to get things wrong - I pretty much though they had covered all those bases and in the last 15 years living in the UK, I have watched their decline with great sadness. My flight to Paris was no exception. Not only was the flight late, overcrowded and not managed at all by disinterested staff - that we sat on the tarmac, full boarded for one hour while we waited for catering to be loaded on (front and then back) left me gobsmacked. As they barely offer any food service anyway (small packet of crisps and an even smaller bottle of water) on a 45 minute flight, I wondered why they thought it was good operational planning to delay a whole plane load of passengers so that 6 people in business class could speedily eat a poor quality meal on the flight to Paris. As it transpired I was over 90 minutes late and missed the meeting I was flying to Paris to attend. Never again."
127,"✅ Trip Verified |  The short haul flights were the best with the crew on the final leg giving the excellent service that we all hope for. We chose out flights very carefully so that we were booked on flights with the Club World Suits not the Ying Yang arrangement that they still offer. At the last minute the aircraft was changed so we had to put up with the ying yang which really should have been pensioned off ages ago! Most business class offer 4 across but this layout still squeezes in 8 across. As we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in Business Class we always lose out on the ""Points game"" but I take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable basis not to be allowed to reserve my seats. The points gained from this trip alone would have allowed us Bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to us. This status would have allowed us to book the seats 7 days prior to departure, when they were still available, rather than the 24 hours when they were not available. On the long haul return flight I was unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the doors had closed there was a window seat still vacant. I asked if I could move and was told by the FA she would check. Nothing happened but after take-off a passenger was moved from economy to that seat. Judging by the interaction between them I would bet it was someone on Staff Travel. I think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this. Take-off was just after 1930 hrs but we were not offered a drinks service before supper but were told we could order a drink that would be delivered on out tray with the meal. Had we done this our meal would have been cold by the time we ate it. In summary would I ever fly with BA again? No, not if I had half a chance of going with another airline. "
128,"✅ Trip Verified |  A very comfortable (new suite) flight with great service and good food. Crew was wonderful New seat is great, except the shoulder strap is very uncomfortable. Entertainment great. Wifi was annoying, cutting off and needing constant reconnecting. Generally a positive experience."
129,"✅ Trip Verified | British Airways is the most terrible airline I’ve dealt with. They have caused our family extreme stress and disappointment - we have tried for a week now to speak to someone as we can’t make the changes online. They hang up on you every time you call them - we have been driven to despair by their treatment of their customers. You can’t check in online, the application sucks so much you’re better off trying to code your own app and it’ll probably work better, every time you try to check in you are taken to a page that says we can’t verify your documents yet the app and website say you’re verified and ready to go. You upgrade and pay for upgrade and it says it’s guaranteed and then when you go to check in which you have to go to the airport for because online won’t work, they give you a different seat than you paid for and a lower class and offer nothing in return.  I hope I never have the misfortune of getting stuck flying with British Airways ever again."
130,✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways is the most terrible airline I’ve ever dealt with. They have caused our family extreme stress and disappointment - we have tried for a week now to speak to someone as we can’t make the changes online. They hang up on you every time you call them - we have been driven to despair by their treatment of their customers. I have no choice but to cancel our chance of a life time trip we’d booked with our 2 18 year old boys as they were flying with another airline and would have been alone in Japan as BA just cancelled our trip and we cannot rebook online as the trip was booked with avios and companion vouchers.
131,"Not Verified |  BA is getting a real bashing on this forum and I thought I'd buck the trend and report a virtually flawless experience of a short hop from EDI to LCY on BA8703 this Monday. Easy check in, decent lounge experience except the very amiable staff were still forced to serve from behind barriers, very clean plane which left on time, ridiculous amount of legroom in 2D (it is a bulkhead seat but with lots more space than 1A or C), reasonable cooked breakfast served by a very attentive and capable CSM and arrived 15 mins earlier than scheduled. What's not to like, which is my overall experience with the vast majority of my BA experiences over the last 25 years. Anyway I thought it would be nice to read a positive review for once."
132,"Not Verified |  New Club Suites are amazing, the only let down is the bed is a little too firm but the pillow was the most comfortable pillow I have ever used. Food was ok as I have had better on BA in the past and I can understand why they put everything on a single tray which is OK. The cabin crew were brilliant but I was surprised that after dinner the crew didn’t once come round with beverages or even bottled water. BA really have a great hard product here and I would suspect the soft product will improve once Covid restrictions become less of an issue. Well done BA."
133,✅ Trip Verified | Very small plane for a busy route. Service was good but food not so. Ran out of a lot and options left were not good. Cabin crew for BA actually really friendly.
134,"✅ Trip Verified |  BA continue to charge a premium for the most disgusting service, provided by people who shouldn't be in customer service, on tired, dirty and cramped aircraft. Out of 11 flights this year, not one has managed to depart or arrive at their destinations on-time. Including having 3 business class tickets cancelled and an alternative in economy being offered, still no refunds 3 months on and had a flight late and missed connection, so BA cancelled the rest of my ticket, leaving me stranded in the US. "
135,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew back on BA0254 Bridgetown to Heathrow in the old Club Class. A huge disappointment after going out in the new Club Class suites - the end of this awful yin and yang seating can't come soon enough. Even tried to pay BA's extortionate pre-booking rate for our seats - none left to choose even weeks ahead. My wife and I were stuck in the middle 2 seats of 4 - 13E and F. Good job it was an overnighter so we managed to sleep a bit and not have to climb over our neighbours very often. The March film selection so not good. Not particularly friendly FA who insisted face masks must be worn even though BA's policy has changed regarding flying back to a non-mask wearing destination (ie. London). Sort it out BA. Took off 20 minutes late but big tailwind so more than made up the time on a relatively smooth flight. Dinner not to bad but breakfast - fairly dire. My wife's smoked salmon bagel was dreadful. As usual when BA is good, it's really good but when it's bad it's awful. I recommend hesitatingly - come on BA, be great again. We pay a lot for ""premium"" seats."
136,"Not Verified |  The worst budget airline I’ve ever used! Far worse than Ryanair and I refuse to fly with them even though they’re basically free. BA charge about 10x as much as other budgets but have the worst service. Spent an hour checking in because their outdated computers crashed. They left us sat on the plane for over 2 hours because they couldn’t connect to the internet, then left 50% of our luggage behind because they would have had to refund everyone’s flights if they waited another 10 mins for the other luggage trolleys to arrive. It took three days to return it and cost us £100s. Then on return I’ve now been sat here nearly two hours and there’s no sign of our luggage again. I don’t know how a company can be this incompetent but I’ll be pursuing for compensation. I have some free flights from Amex but I won’t be using them because it’s not worth going through this again."
137,"✅ Trip Verified | First, the actual flights are fine and the staff on all 3 flights (ZRH-LHR, GVA-LHR & LHR-ZRH), first 2 in Economy, are absolutely fine, chatty and friendly, they are a credit to the company. The infrastructure however is appalling. ZRH-LHR impossible to check-in online and just 2 staff to check-in everyone for 2 flights resulting in mislabelled luggage and an hour delay to sort this out. GVA-LHR, 2.5hrs late as no-one at LHR to tow the aircraft to the gate. LHR-ZRH, 50mins late due to slow gate staff. Even when you check-in online you have to queue at the airport to get the actual boarding pass! There are more examples, and for this reason, until they sort out their stressed ground staff, it is impossible to recommend this airline. Onboard 10/10, getting to be onboard 1/10."
138,"✅ Trip Verified |  Have not flown economy with BA for years, what a shock! Hard uncomfortable seats, small aged tv screens with limited inflight entertainment. Food and service appalling. 13hr plus flight, no socks, eye shades, ear plug amenity pack. And no antibacterial wipes offered. Wi-Fi advertised but not available on flight. Paid premium money for a budget airline, more akin to Easy Jet, RyanAir or JetStar. My last time travelling with BA after more than 18 years of flying with them. BA you really do need to buck up your service and become the flagship Service you used to be."
139,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew to Barbados 16 March on BA 255 in the new Club Class suite. A huge improvement on the old yin and yang Club Class which we unfortunately endured on the way back. Comfortable, big TV screen with high quality picture and good headphones, plenty of nooks and crannies for storing small items and very private. Nice friendly FA's (called by my name from the off) and pretty good drinks service with a good dinner served. Once again let down by a poor (at best) choice of movies on the in-flight entertainment system. Thank goodness the latest James Bond movie was showing. Took off and landed on time. Smooth flight. Only one letdown - the usual extortionate fee charged for pre-booking a seat. Come on BA, stop nickel and diming - it spoils what could be a really good Business Class product and after all we already pay quite a bit for the privilege. I recommend with the usual caveats."
140,"Not Verified |  Very poor flight from Cape Town to London. After the chaos of Cape Town Airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight. Boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne. The captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the 6.00 am lifting of the overnight jet ban at Heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so. This was no big deal. Then the captain announced that due to IT issues at Heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period. With the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for Business Class but this was not forthcoming. In the event take off was permitted quite soon after. The crew had distributed menus but then did a PA to say that there were changes to each of the main courses. A drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks, for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner. Drinks and nuts were served circa 45 minutes after take off, in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne. Dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler. The food looked bland, unappetising and tasted the more so. The cheese (two small pieces) were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney. No top up of the wine was offered (we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis) and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence. The flight was some 11 hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake. Breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner. Coffee or tea were offered by individual mug, orange juice was available on request. Cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items. Come on British Airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes. For the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort (flatbed) as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below 25% of the price paid for the premium cabin. Time was when flying in Business Class was real treat, no longer is this the case."
141,"Not Verified |  Our main complaint is that the limited food served was bland, barely edible, and by far the worst we’ve ever experienced compared to other airlines used in the past. The staff were friendly enough but they were rarely seen between meals. No snacks were offered during the flight. This is so different to every other airline we have used in the past. After 14 hours of flying the breakfast offered was a tiny, cold, stale, Ham and cheese roll and a small plain yoghurt with a couple of Oreos. If ever you decide to fly with them I suggest that you bring your own food. We certainly will on our return flight but will never use British Airways again."
142,"✅ Trip Verified |  Complete and utter chaos at Heathrow, yet again. Surely the CEO, Sean Doyle, must now take responsibility and step aside for the consistent and continuous IT problems that cause flights to be cancelled and delayed. The queue for the First Wing check in at 10am today was over 1 hour, and subsequent flight to Malaga 1.5 hrs late leaving the gate. Updated about the delays 3 times, but strangely not one person apologised or said sorry - BA seems to think this is normal practice nowadays. As Emerald OneWorld, I wish there was an alternative because BA has become intolerable, and this is after flying them for 55 years since BEA/BOAC days."
143,"Not Verified |  Feb 25, 2022. We show up at the airport 3 hours early for our flight to Dublin. we waited in line for 3+ hours to just check in our luggage. After that, we learn our flight is delayed another 3+ hours. We had a connecting flight in London. When trying to go through customs they wouldn't let us through because the boarding of the plane was going to be happening in 30 minutes. They told us to wait in a customer service line that was well over an hour. We then found out we could have gone through customs because the connecting flight from London to Dublin was delayed over an hour. However, by the time we were told this information, the doors were about to close. The next available flight to Dublin was 2/27 late evening. With that being said we were forced to stay the night in London. After talking to a British Airways manager, they informed us that BA would reimburse us for any hotel, flight (to get to Dublin regardless of the airline), clothes (due to them losing our bags), excursions and transportation. Due to this issue, we had to spend multiple days shopping for clothes, lost out on days we had booked to explore the country, had to now buy an extra suitcase for the new clothes we received (went 4 days with lost bags). When we finally got home, we submitted our claims like we were told to do. Within a few days, it's declined. We have asked for a contact # just to talk to somebody, again declined. We tried to reach out via social media and we get passive-aggressive messages.  They refuse to pay me back for the new flight to get to Dublin, transportation to and from the airport in London, the hotel for London, the clothes I had to buy because they lost my bags for 4 days, and the extra luggage fee because of the extra clothes I had to buy. There is no customer support and they are impossible to get a direct response from."
144,"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways are in the process of upgrading all its 777 fleet to the new Club Suite, but BA59 had the 16-yrs-old, packed-like-sardines Club World product. The lounge at CPT was also bursting at the seams and food orders were so behind that many passengers had left by the time their food arrived. On boarding, we were surprised to find that the menu, amenity kit and bottle of water had already been placed in the storage drawer. We suspect this is another cynical time-saving initiative on the part of BA. Frustratingly, the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dishes were probably the worst we have ever encountered in any business class on any airline. The drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious basis of a passenger with a nut allergy. It's hard to avoid suspicions that cabin crew were being economical with the truth. Apart from a rather turbulent ride, the flight was otherwise uneventful and arrival was slightly ahead of schedule. Baggage handling was, however, atrociously slow."
145,"✅ Trip Verified |  We flew to Funchal, Madeira yesterday. Madeira has no COVID restrictions for entry, yet BA asked us to upload our NHS vaccination passes, before we could check in online. I received an OK about an hour later, but my husband did not, so I couldn’t check in online. We arrive at Heathrow 2 hours before departure and stood in a long queue for check in. There were just 3 desks open for a queue of approx 100 travellers. Then several people went on breaks or disappeared so we were down to one desk open, with the queue barely moving. I went to complain to various BA staff, who said the manager had been told and more people were coming. One blonde lady walked around for ages, shepherding travellers into the queue, before sitting down at a desk. Another man later did likewise, making us wonder why they hadn’t simply worked at the desks from the beginning. All in all we stood in that queue for a good hour, before almost running to the security queue, which thankfully moved quickly. Then we hurriedly bought a sandwich, walked to our departure gate and stood on the bus to the plane. The whole experience was extremely stressful; and took the best part of 2 hours. We did not have time to sit down until we did so on the plane. And completely unnecessary! If we had been able to check in online, this would not have happened. My husband’s vaccination pass is fine, but not required for Madeira. I think it is a systems failure as he received an email yesterday morning saying his pass was not in order, as did I, even though I’d previously been told, I could check in online. Also unnecessary as if BA had staffed the desks properly the queue would have moved. A staff member told us BA had laid off lots of staff during lock down and was now begging them to return, but having been treated badly, they didn’t want to. The flight itself was fine, on time. We were given a bag of crisps and a bottle of water, again fine, nothing praise worthy."
146,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely bad experience with "" British Airways."" I have two bookings with them for the past two years. both were cancelled. The first one, I understand, "" Covid-19"" unexpected. But today I got another surprise. My flight to Antalya in May 2022 was cancelled and no explanation is given. I will definitely not book ever again with them."
147,"Not Verified |  Flew BA LHR-AUS on a 787-9 on the outbound leg and then back on the A350-1000 on the return leg. Seats comfortable. Staff service on the inbound leg was disappointing. Safety briefing was missed on LHR-AUS route. LHR-AUS boarding on time, flight flew out on time, landed on time. AUS-LHR boarding one hour late, left an hour late and landed one hour late too. Food quality on both legs was not fit for human consumption. Wife ordered a veg meal which was served cold on both legs. In flight entertainment on outbound leg was bad - 2/3 screens not working. On return leg worked fine, but this is due to the A350-1000 being brand new. Good quality of sleep on both legs, which was good. Check in at LHR was flawless and without incident. Check in at AUS was rotten. We queued and were number 4 in line and waited for 1 hour for staff to check us in. What was clear is staff quality in Austin is poor, passengers did not appear to have passenger locator form(s) ready / VeriFly app ready and / or vaccine detail ready. Having looked at business and premium economy class on both legs, paying business class and premium economy did not appear worth it. Baggage was received fine at AUS and LHR - the latter took ages on return. If I had the option of another airline - I would not fly BA."
148,Not Verified |  The food was awful. An over night early morning flight started with the offer of a terrible chicken wrap thing. Terrible. Then went to a Traditional Breakfast with disgusting sausage and inedible hash brown's. Such rubbish on BA.
149,"✅ Trip Verified | I really can’t believe they have the audacity to call this First Class. The check in staff at Singapore were abrupt and unhelpful. The official BA lounge in Singapore was closed, so they’re using a cheap generic alternative, which anyone can pay twenty pounds to go in. Suffice to say it was not pleasant. Onboard was like being in the middle of a bad comedy sketch. I can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class training. I had to ask for slippers. The first drink took nearly an hour to arrive, despite only having 8 passengers to serve between the two of them. The poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine, which came filled to the brim. I mean it’s First Class, not a student house party. Neither had any knowledge of the wines on the menu. Most of the food was awful. My steak was dry, over cooked and tough, and whichever catering manger signed off on a canapé of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately. I will say, the cheese and port were nice. However the worst thing was the constant galley noise. There was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat (1K) which they were in and out of all night, and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming. They also seemed to have stored their personal belongings in to the bin immediately above my seat, so we’re in and out of that as well. I will say the seat itself is very well designed, but personally I’m happy in Club and would never do First again."
150,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Dubai. Family of 6 kids where from 10 down to 6 years old, savvy travelers, been on many holidays so we were excited to be on BA for first time. But disappointment became desperation as we had not eaten anything since Dublin that morning at 7am. We had no time to eat at LHR so thought we'll get something usually around 1 hour into the flight. 3.5 hours after take off they served out food. Food was fine but nothing special, no issues with beverage, no attention to kids as you'd expect from many other airlines, even a kids book would be good. Movies are all outdated and already watched. So overall very medium experience."
151,"✅ Trip Verified | One would think that the number of crises BA incurs they would have had emergency planning down to a fine art. I last flew with BA May 2017 - yes, the weekend of the last but one IT crisis. I swore never again but ended up purchasing a ticket Aug 2018 to Bologna - BA cancelled the flight. Then covid hit so ended up with a voucher. Fast forward to Feb 26th, 2022. Received a message 5.30am 30mins from LHR that that my flight was cancelled. Arrived at the airport with everyone else just wandering and seeking answers. The staff that were there either told you to go online - a bit difficult as the BA systems were down or ring BA. Ha Ha or go home - not very helpful if you live two hours from LHR. By some miracle the app sprung into life, and I managed to get one of the last 10 seats on the evening flight. Sat in arrivals as there was a coffee shop - soon ran out of seats. By 12.00 midday most of us were trying to get airside to use lounges but no one was allowed in departures until two hours prior to your flight supposedly because of crowds. Pointed out BA should have provided refreshments - told to put a claim in. Eventually got to departures and made it through security. BA customer services (note the oxymoron) - had a consistent queue of about 20 people as BA were still cancelling/rearranging flights for passengers who were airside. Boarded flight 45mins late. Sat on tarmac as the pilot told us the delay was them trying to 'reconcile' luggage. When we took off given one very small bottle of water and a cereal bar for a five-hour flight They purport to be a top-class airline but in fact Ryanair has more finesse. The staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so badly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation - well so are the passengers. The aircraft are cramped and worn. I had been reluctant to use Egyptair but flew home with them on a new aircraft with a very good entertainment system and was provided with a hot meal and snack for same price as a BA ticket. How on earth can BA justify their prices? The management should be sacked as ultimately they are to blame for the ruination of this airline."
152,"Not Verified |  We will never use BA again for a long haul flight. Our experience of the flight from LHR-MLE wasn’t too bad, apart from a screaming child but the return wasn’t a good experience. We weren’t provided with a drink when we boarded as we were forgotten and that happened a few more times during the flight. I think the crew in Premium Economy were very young and not very experienced, leaving the experienced ones in Business/First. Actually, I think BA only care about the Business/First customers now with the cabins getting larger for those classes. They ran out of food choice 8 rows back in our cabin (it’s not a large cabin), ran out of wine straight after the food service and we had no food for 7hrs apart from a couple of biscuits, one of those we had to go and get from the kitchen. We weren’t fed until 1.5hrs before we landed (it was a 11.5hr flight) and then it was a soggy roll containing 2 slices or cucumber and 2 slices of tomato! BA just don’t care anymore about the little people."
153,"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways is getting worse an worse, my flight was 8 mins late. Luggage is taking hours to arrive.  No communication whatsoever from anyone. They can't be reached on the phone and answer with delays to emails, if they do. My app is crashing most of the times. They change the aircraft without notice, so even if you pay for a seat, the staff will say there is nothing they can do."
154,✅ Trip Verified | Paid for 3 business class seats to London from New York. Got downgraded at airport check in because they overbooked business class. Couldn’t even provide compensation or a refund. Told I had to call customer service or submit a form. Unbelievable. Unacceptable. Never again. 
155,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely shambolic customer service. The lounges at Heathrow are outdated and the service was terrible, waited over an hour for my chosen food/drink order to be brought to me. Ended up getting it myself and told off for doing so. On board product is average. "
156,"✅ Trip Verified |  Our flight back to Athens (on a different airline) was very delayed, causing us to miss our first flight home. I understand that they were not required to help due to the delayed flight being a different airline. What's worse is that they went ahead and canceled our tickets for our connecting flight, which we would have been able to make based on another flight out we found, causing us to have to buy much more expensive tickets home that resulted in us having an overnight layover and having to buy a hotel room on top of ridiculously expensive last minute tickets. The absolute worst customer service I have ever dealt with, and I will never be flying with them again."
157,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight took off two hours late after what can only be described as a shambles at the airport. No airbridge to the aircraft which is not acceptable. The aircraft was better than the outbound flight, who screen was so small. After serving only about 2/3rd of the cabin, no first choice. Only a vegetarian dish or a chicken dish from the economy cabin. The airline must know that vegetarians will order a meal, so why include it as a choice. Also, to offer a roll of ham/cheese for breakfast after a 12 hour flight is cost saving. A hot breakfast should be offered. With only 90 minutes between my connecting flight, due to late arrival, I made staff aware. Whilst they let me and others passengers of the flight first, there was no staff to assist in getting us to our flight. It was a struggle to get my connecting flight. On arriving in Glasgow, got txt to say my bags did not make the flight. First time using BA premium and likely my last."
158,"✅ Trip Verified |  There was a mistake on my booking made by BA. Got an email to say ""contact us to discuss"". Took over 30 contact attempts spanning 7 hours and still not resolved. Absolutely the most shambolic customer support I have ever experienced. Still waiting for the call back I was promised 2 weeks ago."
159,"✅ Trip Verified | The economy cabin was surprisingly underpopulated on this flight, with only about 30 passengers, but business class was three-quarters full. Boarding was therefore mercifully quick and take-off on schedule. Sadly, BA59 makes use of the old Club World product, which now seems like a step back in time after experiencing the new Club Suite on BA42/43. There are some good points about the old Club World - the drawer capable of taking a laptop and the more comfortable seat when flat - but other than those, it's an embarrassment. The tiny, poorly responsive screen is almost beyond belief. Service was perfunctory and the meal service conformed to the current, overly cautious, post-Covid requirements, with everything served at the same time. This does mean that the meal is over and done with relatively speedily, but it's a lacklustre experience in contrast to BA's competitors and smacks of continued cost-cutting. Queues for the three toilets in business class were unacceptable at times and there was limited attention paid to keeping them clean. Arrival was on schedule, but Covid paperwork processing meant that it was an hour before we were able to collect our baggage."
160,"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways continues to go downhill. We flew business class and the experience was like economy from 20 years ago except you can have a glass of champagne. We were packed in full 3x3 seats because of IT issue the day before. Even if weren’t, the Seat pitch and width is the same as economy. Gone are the little pretend tables in the middle seat to give some illusion of style. The food was dreadful. The in flight service was unsophisticated. BA used to have an acceptable European business class. They don’t any more. Other European airlines offer much better in flight experience in business class in comparison. BA is taking premium and frequent flyers for granted and treating us like mugs. How I miss the politeness of old BA business class from around 5 years ago, how I used to look forward to it, the small gestures like hanging up a coat, giving you a hot towel, having nice food, being served from the galley, rather than from the manky trolley. COVID is not the reason - this is years of cost cutting and the result is dreadful."
161,"✅ Trip Verified |  Outstanding! From the warm, smiling welcome on board, this flight was excellent. The in flight crew were friendly, attentive and very professional. Detailed announcements from the flight deck as well. Food and wine all very good indeed. The Premium Economy product on BA is also very good. Comfortable seats, foot and leg rests and decent recline. FR superior to any other airline on other Atlantic routes."
162,"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways has scrapped the mandatory wearing of face masks onboard flights, although they pretend publicly that the policy remains. BA454 from London to Malaga on 25th February, and across 6 visible rows around me there were 7 out of 24 passengers wearing face masks - and I was one of them. This was long after the meal / drinks service had been cleared, and remained like that as we landed and deplaned. Cabin crew were frequently up and down the aisles and not a word was said to any of these non compliant passengers, or as they left the aircraft with staff bidding them farewell. I guess they are too scared to remind people to follow the rules? "
163,"✅ Trip Verified |  For once more BA got it all wrong with 6 hours delay, food voucher of 4 pounds and no information or advice. No staff to serve the waiting passengers. The attitude towards the passenger is one of a dispensable commodity."
164,Not Verified |  Another episode of unmitigated shambles when it comes to customer service. The day after Storm Eunice and English half term holidays are getting underway. So you make allowances and you accept there could be some delays. The fact they were then compounded by the late cancellation of a raft of flights to domestic and European destinations on the evening of Saturday 19 February for operational reasons was pitiful. You could not rebook via BA’s website. Instead passengers were compelled to queue at Gate A17 at LHR to possibly rebook and be provided with accommodation overnight. Some BA cabin crew were helpful but those in customer services in the South Lounge who simply directed passengers to the ever growing queues at A17 were a disgrace.
165,✅ Trip Verified |  Check in at IAD was quick and easy. Lounge in Washington was a BA lounge and very good. Sound pre flight food offerings for this overnight flight. Flight on time and boarded promptly. As we had eaten we opted to sleep. There was full dinner and breakfast service for those that wanted it. We slept well. On time arrival and quickly made it to T5 arrivals lounge which was excellent.
166,"✅ Trip Verified |  Very old planes, poor food and minimal leg room in economy. Check in procedure online did not work for me or any of my fellow travellers. Special meal request given weeks in advance for food allergy was ignored. I spoke to a BA customer service representative as soon as I landed in Heathrow who said they could not help and referred to the telephone line who said the same but referred to the online complaints form. Have been trying for weeks to raise this as a concern for those with food allergies and prevent this from happening to others but no reply via their complaints website or on Twitter. Telephone hotline is now also currently unavailable."
167,Not Verified | Having just booked BA for a return flight - being one hour each way in Club Class and paying + 700 euro for 2 persons to be then asked to pay a further 96 euro to choose seats in business. A full business class ticket and a fee for seat? A very disengaged management model.
168,"✅ Trip Verified |  BA got everything right. Allowed evening before check in , this allowed lots of time for staff to help with paperwork needed for travel to the US. On the day of travel it was half term and the Airport busy. In spite of this through security and into lounge in 5 minutes. Lounge clean, staff proactive and food served quickly. Good range of drinks. Easy transfer to C gates. Aircraft ready, boarding quick and well organised. Pre departure drinks served. The cabin crew were excellent and provided a very good service. The food was the new club world menu options ( roast beef) which was excellent. Although it was the older club world product it was clean and well maintained. On time arrival, baggage off very fast. Overall an excellent flight and it feels like BA are improving their offering at a time when many other providers use COVID as an excuse for service cut backs Well done"
169,✅ Trip Verified |  Appalling customer service - they have cancelled flights and rebooked us but have not confirmed any change to the hotel reservation that was part of the inclusive booking. Hours and hours on the telephone with no response (or you just get a recorded message to say they can't take the call). They don't respond to emails sent to the complaints line. 
170,"✅ Trip Verified |  This past November/December I flew Washington-London return and, on the strength of that trip (my first in two years), the inflight service quality appears to have pretty much returned to the pre-pandemic status quo ante. The cabin was clean and well maintained, seats were comfortable, food and drinks were good (including a very tasty Hertfordshire roast pork on the return leg), and the BA cabin crews remain the best in the business. This was one of a number of bookings that I had to re-book a number of times due to flight cancellations, and contrary to the experience of many here, my re-bookings were handled courteously and thoroughly (although I did have a number of lengthy waits on hold, but under the present circumstances that's to be expected). It's good to see that the everyday product has held up so well amid this dreadful time, and I'm looking forward to future trips on BA."
171,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had the best experience I have ever had with an airline. Our initial flight to Dubai was canceled By Royal air Maroc and we had to find a new flight at the last minute. I found that booking with them was extremely simple. Unfortunately, we had to cancel our flight the day of the departure. I called the customer service, waited about 20 minutes before I could speak with someone and within 15 minutes, the flight was canceled and they offered me a full refund. The person on the line was extremely nice, understanding and willing to help us. I had never dealt with such a nice employee from any airline. I got the full refund on my credit card the day after. I usually chose the cheapest flight ticket, regardless of the airline, but from now on, I’ll definitely make sure to check with British airways first."
172,"Not Verified | BA cancelled our original return flight and rebooked us a day later. We had no issue with this, just enjoyed an extra days holiday but others might not have been so flexible. However, they overlooked rebooking our connecting flight from LHR and we were fortunate that there was still space on the flight when we checked in at ATL. The aircraft was newish and in excellent condition, flight was around 50% capacity. Service was excellent, staff were friendly and efficient. Dinner was good, breakfast was disappointing with little choice. The LHR to BHD leg was equally good and I am beginning to think that BA are getting their mojo back again."
173,"✅ Trip Verified | Boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack air-con at the gate. The Club Suite cabins were about 3/4 full, but the rest of the plane can't have been much more than 20% occupancy. Whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say, but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins. Despite that, the drink and food service in business was efficient, and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after take-off, which is a real bonus on a night-time flight. However, the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible. The Club Suite is a big improvement on the ancient CW product, although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two. One definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old CW. The large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole IFE system was much more responsive. The new seats don't significantly aid sleeping, particularly as there's an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine. Waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets. Performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard and arrival was twenty minutes ahead of schedule. Progress through border control was speedy but baggage collection was delayed for unspecified reasons. Overall, a good flight."
174,"✅ Trip Verified |  Unfortunately having just flown in the new club world cabin this time we had an incredibly old plane. The good was the cabin crew who tried to make the trip as pleasant as possible. The bad was the in-flight entertainment, the screens were unwatchable when they worked, my wife’s didn’t, and post iPad era just don’t live up. The food was just about okay without being anything special but all served at once. Apparently the crew explained this is because of a shortage of staff. I’m afraid BA has a lot to do to regain its standing in the aviation world, the competition is too fierce now to sit on your laurels."
175,"Not Verified |  Utterly appalling company. We've flown with them two times now, and both times it's been a disaster. The first time: Return flight was delayed by over 24 hours. There was nobody at the gate to tell us this, so a large group of passengers had to roam round Dubai airport looking for BA staff. There were none. Eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs, where a very angry person told us it was our fault, and we should have been given a letter. We had no letter. They then put us on a bus to the other terminal. When we arrived, there was nobody to greet us. We were literally just left there. We had to, yet again, contact another airline, who managed to find us transport to the hotel. When we got there, we were told it was full and we couldn't choose our rooms. We were given a terrible, dirty, cramped room. Several times throughout the night we were called to tell us our flight had been moved. Eventually we got to board the next day. My tray table was broken, as was the window blind, and I didn't get a meal. No compensation was offered. The second time I need to reschedule my flight. The website assured me this was fine, but provided no link. I needed to phone up. If you need to phone BA, don't even bother trying. I never got to speak to anyone, and just ended up booking a hotel to wait for my flight rather than rescheduling. The food has been terrible, meagre portions given infrequently. My sandwich was inedible. 
"
176,Not Verified | Over the past 2 years I have flown with British Airways twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in London Heathrow for a 1 hour flight home to Newcastle. While the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at Heathrow are useless. First time in February 2020 I got stuck in Heathrow due to Storm Ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault. However the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke. They had 4 to 5 staff ran a kiosk queue of over 100+ unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker. Their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop. In the end after a 12 hour battle I was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when I finally spoke to someone. In November 2021 I decided to give BA a second chance and booked to go to New York. Since the plane landed late into LHR I missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at Heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while. As I rushed through customs I did manage to make it to the gate with 5 minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight. My layover was now 10 hours and all I got from the guest services was a £12 food voucher to spend and a phone number for what I thought was complaints but after being on hold for 20 minutes found out it was not from complaints. Considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for £12 seemed really cheap. A few days after I got home I then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed I was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working. When I got a response I said I wanted 20-25% back off my holiday. I got an apology and told the staff at Heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation I was offered nothing! 
177,"✅ Trip Verified |  Return trip Cape Town to Durban in Club Class highlighted the inconsistency. Our outbound trip in December was good in all respects, whereas the return trip was disappointing. Check in was fine, apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority, resulting in a long wait for our third bag. The lounge was busy, but no complaints. We went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen, where there was no sign of activity, although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time. Shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from 1330 to 1410 and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates. The informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate. I checked on the flight radar app, which showed that our aircraft had started in Durban, and flown to Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, back to Cape Town, and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight. In fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late. Boarding eventually started at 1400 with departure at 1430, 60 minutes late. Drinks service only started 30 minutes later, followed by lunch. The food was good but the wine offering very mediocre, and not up to club standards. With the price of good wines in South Africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine. Lunch service was quick, but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested. Overall this was a disappointing flight with a lacklustre crew"
178,"✅ Trip Verified |  I used British Airways for the first time and I have to admit that I am impressed with their service! Firstly, I want to thank the lady that assisted me to weigh my luggage. My flight was 16:10, however due to unforeseen circumstances, I arrived at the airport around 15:40. I was convinced that I was going to miss my flight because the queue was very long. I stood there a few minutes but then realized that I would miss my flight. I went to ""Club check-in"" and the lady was incredibly kind to me. I just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though I was at fault. She weighed my luggage and I was able to board the flight successfully. I was not aware that this airline gives out free meals. We got a sandwich and drink and we had an option to choose between vegetarian and chicken. I personally love free stuff so I will be ditching Flysafair (even though they have excellent service as well) in the near future, unfortunately. Diversity; The first time I flew was in 2018 and I have to admit that I have never seen such diversity amongst cabin crew staff however with British Airways it was different.  The staff was very kind and friendly as well. What a wonderful experience to fly with these guys!"
179,"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on British Airways from Detroit to Bangalore and back. Given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers, I decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket. I was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that I was special because I spent that extra money or was in Business class. From shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff, I experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys. The trump was being stranded in London having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight. Being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn. Some special passengers were escorted to the Club World check in. When we asked the lady, she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up. Needless to say it never did. Finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked. So I come back to the question: Can big corporations lie with no accountability? Why would I spend my hard-earned money on something that gave me nothing extra? Shame on you British Airways for your complete disregard for your passengers. Stop your lying or update your promises!"
180,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have flown with BA for many years and today was another poor experience as I’ve witnessed the airline decline into a sub-par service. I understand that it’s been a tough two years for airlines but BA’s decline started before the pandemic and it has now truly plummeted. Enormous queues at JFK BA check-in terminal 7. Even the priority lane was at a standstill for at least half an hour before people started complaining they’d miss their flights. Terrible efficiency at the check-in counters. At times, only one member of staff is processing people whilst other BA staff stood around on their phones or having a chat. One member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in. The interior of the plane was generally filthy, crumbs, bits of food, stains, marks all around the seating area. They give you a single wet wipe which I used to think was for your hands but now I see most passengers wiping down their surrounding area. There are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally. On this particular flight one of the cabin crew is as swearing about his colleague at the back of the plane who apparently wasn’t pulling his weight. Very poor. I used to be a proud BA flyer but now I just feel like I’m clinging on to my airline status which doesn’t actually provide you a better service these days."
181,"✅ Trip Verified |  The entertainment selection was sub par, minimal selections and the new releases were  not new releases. My food left something to be desired. Two of the seats in our row the earphone jack didn’t work. The plane was either uncomfortably hot or too cold, find a medium temp. Just overall a very basic generic airline."
182,"✅ Trip Verified |  Straightforward and friendly baggage drop. On to South Lounge, no polite conversation on have you used our lounge before, no indication that it was so busy there was nowhere to sit at all considering even the 1.5m distancing. Had to roam the entire lounge, lugging our bags on the carpeted floor, with no success at all. Gave up after 20 minutes and decided to try another lounge. Arrived and everything was actually right in front of us and actually found somewhere to sit after 5 minutes of looking around. Menu was basic with no eggs, hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffins. Ordered a frittata as was so hungry. Made my way to the self-serve coffee counter which had basic coffee and was straight away put off by flies hovering over the croissants and fruit. Flight was departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and as if to rub salt in the wound were then told that DXB flight usually leaves from there and should’ve gone to the lounge near there. Looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart. However, the doors cannot close till take off. I asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the Menu and it took them over an hour. Lunch came in another almost hour. Asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person, said will surely try but clearly didn’t, with no apologies or even trying. Portions were small, plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished. Chocolates are Lindor. Nothing special about the other amenities, toilets were no different to what you’d expect, amenity kit was basic, duvet seemed well used. It was not worth almost 4 times the amount of a regular ticket. Naive to trust claims of world class standards."
183,"Not Verified | On arrival at the Warsaw Airport the check in zone was the only one that was not announced on the flight board - we had to guess and ask random people where to go. Once we finally found the check-in desks, luggage drop and check-in was appalling. It took us over 1.5 hours to get our bags checked (and we were half way through the queue). The whole process was disorganised and very slow, really the last thing you want when looking after 2 small, impatient kids. Lady in Warsaw Airport who was supposed to direct passengers to the correct queue was useless. One check-in desk for Euro Traveller / Club Europe, one for bag drop and one for the check-in.  Flight left delayed but the pilots managed to catch up and landed with a small delay, crew on the plane was nice and attentive. Luckily the in air experience was much better, but sort out your ground service at Warsaw Airport."
184,"✅ Trip Verified |  In Glasgow one check in desk open. Huge queue with no business check in. It took me close to an hour to bagdrop. Getting onto the aircraft in Glasgow, no hello from the crew and the same getting off.  I normally find BA cabin crew very nice. Breakfast was a very tired looking croissant.  I used the BA lounge in Terminal 3. Not very keen on the new table service. Poor choice and miniscule portions. Lounge staff were very nice in both directions. On arrival at LHR there was a coach transfer from T5 to T3. We were packed in like sardines. So much for social distancing. The flight from LHR to Pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another 2hrs 30 mins. Captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage handlers to load the containers. No drinks or anything offered while we waited. Food was not even worth mentioning. As far as Club Europe goes it's not worth the extra cost. No priority baggage as mine were last onto the belt in Pisa, seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off. The first officer summed it up when we arrived in Pisa- Sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by BA, and he was right. For the return trip on Hogmanay we left on time. I've never been on a flight to or from Pisa which has left in time. Pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable. On board I gave the food a miss.  Heathrow back to Glasgow Flight left on time. Food was an antipasto of some sort which I declined.  Both cases were last off again. Club Europe is really not worth the money as you are in an economy cabin. I would have thought that BA would do more about their food and onboard service since the cabin is what it is."
185,"✅ Trip Verified | After two years of being unable to fly to our second home in South Africa because of COVID, it was fantastic to be back on board a BA flight to CPT, and in the Club Suite seats (1K and 2K) to boot. These seats are a huge improvement on the old yin-yang CW seats in terms of privacy, ease of access and the IFE screen, but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat. Storage was a mixed blessing, too, with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old CW, meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above. The food onboard was woeful, although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isn't dragged out. Cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm, and there were the usual queues for the toilets. The flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time. CPT had an efficient arrangement for checking forms immediately after leaving the airbridge and there were no queues at immigration. It was good to be back!"
186,"✅ Trip Verified |  I paid $1189 for a round trip flight to London and back in premium economy. They bumped me from the seat for the flight back, and told me I'd be issued a refund. Instead of being issued a refund I had to contact them through several different methods, phone, website, Twitter, and finally email. They told me I'd be getting $229.16 back, which is less than half of the $589 I paid for the upgrade. Instead they refunded $14.58. I emailed again and they told me I'd be getting $115.16 more back. When I emailed again saying that that doesn't add up to the original amount I was told I was getting they simply replied with ""That's the final amount."" Turns out that meant they were taking back the initial refund of $14.58 and I was only getting $115.16 total. So I emailed them again asking why they changed the amount and they've yet to respond. So I called this morning and after explaining politely what I was calling for they hung up on me."
187,"✅ Trip Verified | Very nice return flight with BA. To add to my previous review, I really like how BA organises boarding and disembarking processes in groups, this is super comfortable as 100+ passengers don’t jump out and then sweat in a queue when the gate is not even there. The A320 was new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lighting. Row 1 has an enhanced legroom and thus, makes the 1-hour hop very comfortable. Once again, amazing staff, and they were even more attentive and accommodating to Gold level passengers: always coming and asking if any help is needed. Lovely humus, beetroot and quinoa salad for food. Great WiFi at really competitive pricing + I think it is great that they also have food / alcohol offered to buy online for all travel classes. Domestic T5 arrivals is a breeze."
188,"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall, a very lovely flight with BA to Edinburgh during Christmas holidays. Lounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when I travelled last time). Although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23C) and Had a funky lighting. Although seats are the same as those in Economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at Air France) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for Gold card passengers, BA automatically reserves row 1 in Club Europe with enhanced legroom which I think is a great touch). The crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste. Afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty. I am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust. For a quick hop, BA ticked all the marks here (in comparison, on a CDG-LHR leg Air France presented a ‘chic’ cold starter, however, to me, it looked a bit too complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / KLM served a super nice and simple Chicken Caesar but it was in a paper box). One big drawback was the First wing experience at T5: the queue there was so long that I decided to go through the regular lines instead. It’s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a Gold status. Nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback. The flight was £200 one way (£600 return incl. transfer to Kirkwall) which was pretty expensive, however, the service seemed like it was worth the money."
189,"Not Verified |  First of this was one of the smoothest UK to US flights I have taken. The boarding was appalling and had families with kids queue for no reason at all. They called families to the front but then decided to board business and premier classes first which I appreciate why but why call families? The worse seats ever and the legroom was appalling. The entertainment system is basic, it does not support Bluetooth headphones, the USB does not support your own devices for movies although the website says yes and the headphones input was as good as useless.  The crew were nice so sorry I missed that."
190,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flying during covid is always a challenge. BA’s VeriFLY app worked perfectly and on-line check-in was seamless. The bags drop at T5 was seamless and boarding was done efficiently by zones. Although an older 777 it had been refurbished and everything was new and clean. The cabin crew were a credit to the airline – smartly dressed, friendly and keen to please. We were offered two drinks before lunch was served, with more drinks with the meal. The food was acceptable and we were given a tasty sandwich before landing. Obviously it was only economy but, after 8 hours flying, I arrived relaxed and unstressed."
191,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew to Nashville via Chicago in first. Excellent check in and security. Lounge was good. Food and drink choices very good. First cabin on 787 is 8 seats. Comfortable seat, entertainment a little clunky. Cabin service top banana!! Food and drinks choices and tastes amazing for an aircraft. A special call out to Stewart Tim. A credit to BA."
192,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had low expectations of business class BA on European routes but this flight was even worse. T5 is a mess with 90 minute queue to check bags with tons of people arriving late. Check in guy seemed clueless about Turkey needs for pcr etc. BA lounge is a joke so i went out and got sushi from a restaurant - there was mulled wine in crowded lounge but just bad all round. Boarding was chaos and we left an hour late. A320 was jammed full but business class there is little legroom and just the middle seat free, you might as well fly a low cost carrier for same seat. There is no inflight screen no overhead screen. Although the curtain was closed economy people used the forward bathroom with no crew sending them back. The only salvation was a pretty decent shepherds pie and red wine otherwise I would avoid flying BA. The next day I flew the same aircraft type to Bahrain on another carrier with proper business class seat in flight screen, headphones, good food and drinks, Arabic coffee, dates and gracious service. BA hang your head in shame."
193,"✅ Trip Verified |  We've just used the new Club World for the first time and were delighted with the new configuration. The privacy afforded is so much better, in-flight entertainment and storage were brilliant. Unfortunately, we had the most lethargic crew ever who once the meal was served basically disappeared. The wines were warm, they even forgot to offer my wife a drink with lunch, and she also had a pair of used socks in her storage cabinet. Heathrow was a nightmare as often happens. Being 5 minutes early was rewarded with a 40-minute wait for a gate, then a 2.5 hour wait for our luggage, absolutely shocking in Covid times."
194,"✅ Trip Verified |  My flight yesterday 18/12/2021 was due to take off at 1215, soon after reaching the gate first passengers were called for pre-boarding, then gate staff said the aircraft has not been given permission to land at Aberdeen due to poor weather. Airport information kept telling passengers to go to gate for a further hour and a half before passengers learned the flight had been cancelled via the BA APP, we then had to join a line for the customer service desk, it took two hours to reach the desk in my case, on reaching the desk I was told I had automatically been booked on the following mornings flight and being offered overnight hotel. That did not meet my needs so I requested cancellation and to get my bags back, I was told to cancel my booking on the BA APP, they could not do it at the desk. I was then directed via a gate to collect my bags, this meant having to go via the UK border to reach a baggage belt, then I waited for my bags for 3 hours because they had automatically stored my bags for the following days flight. BA staff were rude and dismissive of customer complaints at length of time bags were taking to arrive, like it was our fault for cancelling the alternative flight they had offered the next day."
195,"✅ Trip Verified |  It is first time we have flown BA business class in a 777 aircraft and hopefully it will be the last. Firstly, the check-in and crew were great - friendly and helpful. It was manual check-in, not a machine, which is always much nicer. No complaints at all in that department. Food on the journey was adequate but no choice of starter, or desert and 3 choices for main course, Business class seating is 2-4-2 with alternate seats facing backwards, as are both the centre seats. We were in those, so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat, or you put the screen up  and you are in a claustrophobic bubble. You cannot see out. You cannot see other passengers. It was slightly better as it was my wife and myself, but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger.  Nowhere to put a glass, bottle of water, book, or glasses within easy reach, unless you keep the table down. In most business class seats you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing, but there is nowhere to put a bag, so everything has to go in the overhead locker, and they are missing over the first 4 rows of centre seats, so not much storage space. We were in row 1 and to get out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row 2. Now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case, but normally if, as a couple, you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partner's legs, not some stranger. I am 5ft 10 and could just about manage. My wife at 5ft 4 could not get over without disturbing the passenger in the row behind. The reading light was hopeless and did not shine on your book and the light controlled from the handset did not work at all. This is utterly awful design and will certainly make us avoid BA in future, if at all possible."
196,"✅ Trip Verified |  I claimed my miles right after my trip at the beginning of August, they took almost 4 months to reply and to my surprise to reject my request without providing any reasons. I have sent them a complaint per E-mail and I still didn't get a reply. It has been 4.5 months and I am still waiting for an answer. Furthermore, many people were not wearing masks and when I asked the flight attendants why they were allowing people not to wear the masks they said there are medical exceptions. When we ordered more drinks they replied that we needed to pick them out ourselves, what a business class customer service."
197,"✅ Trip Verified | British Airways is taking reservations and then cancelling flights without giving any reasons. We had further plans that all needed to be cancelled because of the flights. BA did nothing to ease the process and offered absolutely no explanation of why the flight was cancelled, I am not going to travel on BA again and may not travel again this year at all."
198,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have a flight booked for January 2022, they send me an email at the beginning of December informing me that my flight was changed. My second flight was moved to the next day, making my layover 26 hours, called them, was told to just cancel. What kind of answer is that? I mean I still need to fly to where I am going, and booking with another airline closer to the day I am flying will be more expensive. It is a very big inconvenience for me and I don't even get an apology, just cancel!"
199,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had a future travel voucher for Singapore to London which I thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home. I'd been under the impression that it was a simple process - just call up and book onto the same route that I'd previously paid for (and that had previously been cancelled by BA themselves) - but on a new date. How wrong I was. First, I had to pay to top up my flight - a significant amount, equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles. This was because of price increases and the fact that I was flying at peak times. The extra charge also meant that I overall paid more than face value (their online price at the time for the ticket) for the flight, as well as them still keeping the airlines I'd redeemed. They explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and that's just how the system works. However, if I had taken a refund I would have lost a lot of money to administration fees. They had me in a desperate situation where I was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what I did, so I cut my losses and booked the flight. Or at least I thought I did. The call centre agent - who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision (and no way to escalate issues) - took my card details (including full card number, dates, and CVC code) - and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow. A week later, I still had no ticket, no details, no charge to my card, no booking reference - nothing. I called up to confirm. The call centre agent I reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details. Once again, I waited another week, and sign of being booked onto a flight. Thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to British Airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight, spanning over 6 weeks.  On the Friday before my Monday flight, I sat in tears to another BA call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag. The next day - around 48 hours before I was due to fly, I finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag. Luckily, I noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online. The whole experience was stressful, costly, and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to British Airways hold music. Furthermore, there has been a significant cutback to BAs inflight catering service due to COVID, resulting in smaller portions, leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight. Though I've flown BA repeatedly with few problems in the past, their service has gone significantly downhill."
200,"✅ Trip Verified | I was seated right next to the galley and lavatory in the aisle. During the safety talk the cabin crew were only metres away talking loudly which was irritating, so my initial impression was disappointed for business class. However, into the flight I found one female crew very personable and was offered a seat two back. I was not provided with a complimentary travel wallet, so did not realise that socks and sleep mask were available, and I needed to ask for a pillow. The menu guide was on cheap paper and, with no convenient place to store it for reference later, was very ordinary. The evening meal was acceptable (soup, steak/veg, fruits ) was OK served with freezing cold cutlery. Bed was ok but nowhere to store spectacles or personal needs such as spectacles, asthma puffer, or water bottle. The breakfast of juice and cereal/yoghurt was fine but the single poached egg was like a rubber ball and the included fish patties were unpalatable. The lavatory was spacious and allowed room to change clothes ready for the connecting flight. Overall I expected a better level of attention to detail and a more upmarket delivery. The only business class addition feature that I appreciated was being able to stretch out for some sleep. BA ground staff were unable to link my second flight on a QF 11 from Singapore to Brisbane, insisting I needed to collect my luggage, leave arrivals and recheck in for next flight. I am 73 with some mobility problems, requiring assistance, so this was a worry for me. When I arrived in Singapore, the kind assistance girl arranged to take me to a special transit desk where it was no problem arranging for my bags to be forwarded to next flight."
201,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight was OK, minor delay didn't both me. What was astonishing is that we had to wait an hour or so to drop off our luggage because at Lyon Airport they were training new ground staff at the same time? They continued doing this even though the cue became pretty huge and time started to run out to make it to the flight."
202,"✅ Trip Verified |  
Gatwick to Barbados return. I normally travel on BA with low expectations with the result that I am not too disappointed and sometimes pleasantly surprised. The outbound flight was about par for the course with a reasonably comfortable seat and an OK cabin crew that did just about enough to look after us and make the flight uneventful. However, the flight did leave bang on time and managed to land in Barbados before the Virgin flight that was scheduled to leave Gatwick five minutes before us, with the result that we got through arrivals quickly. The return flight a week later managed to reinforce my low expectations of BA with one of the poorer flights that we have experienced over the last few years. Once again when you travel west to east, the crew (specifically one lady who was looking after our part of the cabin) somehow feel they have to rush through every part of the drinks and meal service that it becomes an ordeal. The pre departure drinks were missed on all of seats on the left hand side of the PE cabin (not a big deal but irritating non the less). No bread was served with dinner, despite there being butter on the plate, so I presume it was missed. My wife had ordered a veggie meal and was served about ten minutes before everyone else, which was fine. However, as the crew were serving the remaining meals, there was a continual dialogue across the two aisles about what selections they each had on their respective trolleys. When they reached our row, they somehow thought it would be a good idea to try and pass a hot tray of chicken in gravy across the four middle seats with the result that the red hot gravy spilled on the my wife's remaining food and lap, although fortunately she did have a napkin in place which absorbed most of the liquid. It also spilled on my Kindle which thankfully had the cover closed. A very brief apology was given but without any sincerity and I suspect blissfully unaware of the obvious mistake they had made. My wife's wine was replaced but not the rest of her dinner. Once again we landed on time, which was a good thing. Overall, the return flight was extremely poor."
203,"✅ Trip Verified |  Marseille to London. I am generally annoyed with the quality of the service. I believe that we should not have to pay for a glass of water with slice of lemon in a BA flight. I realised that I forgot a big duty free bag in the plane after the passport control. I went to the BA Helpdesk, the staff sent me to terminal 5 at the lost and found to pick up my bag while it was not even there. Luckily, I decided to stop on the way in the lost and found of terminal 3, where they (the friendly lost and found staff and not the BA staff) nicely explained me that there was no point for me to go there and called some other agents to help me. "
204,"✅ Trip Verified |  The cabin crew on flight BA035 London to Chennai were very efficient and did their best to take care of their clients. I did tell them I would write a review and here it is. Keep up the good service and, thanks!"
205,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Malaga. Check in was fairly quick. The check in area at Gatwick is quite nice although they are failing with general upkeep. The whole area needed vacuuming and there were stains and signs of chewing gum on the carpets. If you’re not going to look after it then you better just having normal airport flooring. The lounge at Gatwick is really nice and whilst it was very busy, there were still available comfy and desk style chairs to suit. The food and drink offering was very good. Tasty and varied. On board I was lucky to be able to book the exit row, which actually makes the seats better than club in my opinion. Food and drinks service was fairly slow although being near the front this wasn’t a problem for me. The food offering is fairly poor really, a couple of sandwiches or snacks.. drinks selection is better. What was very nice was, near the end of the flight I was given a free glass of champagne for being a silver member. I wouldn’t expect this, and I’m sure it’s just because they had a bottle to use up, but it was a nice gesture to show to frequent flyers. Still no WiFi or WiFi based in flight entertainment offered. Priority bag tags as usual are kind of irrelevant. My bag took quite a long time to come through and was preceded by dozens of non priority bags. Overall a decent flight, and very good value as I paid using avios. Being silver and getting lounge access and free seat selection was a massive plus."
206,"✅ Trip Verified |  Boston to London Heathrow, was excited to experience A380 for the first time. Paid a steep $91 for the seat selection on the upper deck. Was very comfortable with storage cabin beneath the Window. Seat itself was the standard one, comfortable. The boarding was efficiently managed for such a large aircraft. There was never a massive crowd in front of the gate. The inflight service for the outbound leg was less than ideal. The food was very mediocre at best - not worth losing sleep over it. There was serious bumps along the way midflight. The A380 being so massive easily absorbed it. Return was on a B777 - flight was not full but almost full. The inflight service and the food served were both remarkably better than the outbound journey. The baggage drop area however was a disaster. None of the machines worked and there was single kind hearted person assisting passengers. The boarding was again very orderly. Both outbound and inbound IFE was good but not as good as some long haul carriers. If both legs had similar cabin crew and food I would have scored them higher. "
207,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Cape Town in First and our first taste of the new 'soft' product. Still, unfortunately, a 30 year-old 747 that hadn't had its refurbishment and was showing its age. A wardrobe door that's falling off its hinges, a non-touch touch screen and a cupboard door in the washroom that won't stay shut don't pass muster in First and blemish the impression of the positive changes in the on-board service. The young mixed fleet crew did a reasonable job and served drinks and food efficiently without the wait other reviewers have complained about. Care was also taken in preparing and plating up the food. For once, nothing was overcooked and even the beef was decent. Bedding is also improved, with a good quality duvet and large pillow. The IFE remains the same low-res screen quality and the new headphones are uncomfortable worn for more than the duration of a single film. The goodies bag is much better and worth taking home. Overall, a pretty good flight, but it remains to be seen what BA will do with its long-in-the-tooth First Class when their new Club Suites are launched."
208,"✅ Trip Verified |  This review is specifically aimed at the excellent cabin crew on BA 174 from JFK New York to Heathrow on Tue 14th May. I was travelling back from New York following a few days break with 11 girlfriends. Check in and boarding was all on schedule,however it was identified that there was a technical problem and the captain advised passengers that some assistance was required to rectify the issue; this resulted in over an hour's delay leaving NY. Despite this annoying delay, the cabin crew more than made up for this. They were friendly, polite and couldn't do enough to ensure our journey was comfortable and enjoyable, they were all exceptional, even those that were not serving in the section I was in. I do hope that this information is passed on."
209,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Aberdeen. Before boarding the flight I was forced to check in my bag at the gate because apparently the flight was full and I was boarding in Group 5. I was traveling with the permitted allowance and discussed with the lady at the Boarding Gate. I saw people boarding with Tax free bags on top of the other bags. Being almost the last on the plane, there was free spaces to accommodate bags. I was not happy because I had the permitted allowance. "
210,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Dubrovnik. Overcrowded lounges, business class seats same as economy with middle seat empty. LGW lounge opens one hr before some EU flights in morning only and met by a large queue. And now frequent flyers don’t get free baggage anymore on long haul cheap tickets."
211,"✅ Trip Verified |  I paid an extra £500 for two Premium economy seats on this long haul flight and was very disappointed. The seat felt small and was shabby, the tv screen was small and very dark. I tried to adjust it but it was still unwatchable. The whole experience was very poor, not Premium in any way. The return flight was a code share with Japan Airines which was Premium, a whole different experience. I would be happy to pay for their Premium seats. I would advise avoid British Airways Premium economy as it is far from Premium. I felt a complete waste of £500."
212,✅ Trip Verified |  Faro to Heathrow. Flight was very good no issues at all but yet again baggage collection was a disaster. We fly club or first all the time and without fail the baggage is always last off. Spoke to BA desk and they were clueless and had no idea why this happens or how to stop it and correct it. Same happened on flight out too. It is a shambles and a disgrace. Waited 39 mins got cases at Heathrow and this is unacceptable will kit be using them again. Avoid at all costs.
213,"✅ Trip Verified | Vancouver to London. An excellent flight on BA. I travel this route several times a year and generally BA are much better than AC, Especially on this flight, BA were way ahead of the competition. Seats comfortable, food pretty good for economy, decent wine and the in flight crew, simply outstanding. Professional, smiling, friendly. They embodied BA at their very best."
214,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Tenerife. All so wrong. Lounge really overcrowded / food on the plane pretty horrid, left most of it. Paid for and travelling Business Class and allocated four rows away from my partner,  this is normal procedure. Apparently on top of a £2000 six night holiday I should have paid another hundred pounds plus to sit with my partner - total madness. This is an airline with a self destruct button, such a shame.Have just booked Norwegian for our next flights to Barcelona and Buenos Aires, did not even bother to look at BA."
215,"✅ Trip Verified | Washington to London. Having travelled out to Washington from Heathrow on 23/04/19 First Class I wasn't overly impressed. Although the Concorde Room was relaxing and comfortable, the bar staff were a mixture of attentive and somewhat dismissive. The cabin crew were polite but quite surgical in their manner which gave an overall impression of a cold and clinical approach. My return journey couldn't have been more different. The BA lounge was very well presented with a fantastic choice of both food and drink but the hi-light of my return flight were the engaging nature of the cabin crew. Nothing short of amazing. I was offered the usual amenities upon boarding but what set this flight apart from the start was the very happy and friendly nature of the crew. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble and they took the time to chat with me and showed a real general interest in what we talked about. Demeanour was perfect with both a very professional yet relaxing and engaging approach. A fantastic sense of humour and seemed genuinely delighted to assist. Having had mixed levels of service with BA and always flying Virgin I think BA need to track down this staff member and use her as the model for all future cabin crew training."
216,"✅ Trip Verified | Rome Fiumicino to London City. A BA Cityflyer service. No wait to check in. Aircraft was not full. We pushed back early and arrived early. This route still has complimentary refreshments in economy, including wine – a great bonus and pleasant surprise. Cabin service was pleasant and professional. A really excellent flight."
217,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Shanghai. The most disappointing business class I have flown in a long time. The plane was old, worn and dirty (there were crumbs of food on the seat and the floor from a previous flight), It took 2 hours to for drinks service to reach my seat after take off - the food followed shortly, which was over cooked. They seemed to be short on staff. However, what made me really angry was that there were people in the cabin who had had both drinks and food and were having their beds turned down before I’d even been offered a drink. The service was exceptionally poor. I am flying home tomorrow and am not looking forward to the flight. As a Gold card holder, you might have thought BA would check their frequent fliers are being looked after? I’ll return to using other airlines in the one world group for my long haul trips, such as Cathay, JAL or Finnair. The only reason that I’ve given more than one star is that I managed to sleep quite well - the bedding and pillows were good. Ultimately though - sorry BA, not good enough."
218,"✅ Trip Verified | Their customer service is horrible. Lost our bags. Here we sit in London after 2.5 days of wearing the same clothing. We fly out in 3 hours to Barcelona for a 14 day cruise and have pretty much lost any hope of being reunited with our bags before we go. I spent so much $$$ on this trip to celebrate my husbands 60th birthday and our 5th wedding anniversary. It was supposed to be our trip of a lifetime. We have really been trying to make light of things, but not getting our bags today, as it's now Friday and we left on Tuesday AM from Seattle, is heartbreaking. Not one single person at British Airways has handled this with any kind of urgency or empathy, for that matter. One customer service agent even asked me if we would be OK getting out to Heathrow to ""pick them up."" Truly the worst customer experience I've had."
219,"✅ Trip Verified |  London City to Zurich, I fly this route a lot, around 8 times per year, The flight was delayed initially by an hour, I was kept up to date via the app so I was not disappointed. Around 45 minutes into the flight one of the crew member came over with a card in his hands wishing me a Happy Birthday followed by a bottle of Champagne, Brandy etc, this was totally unexpected, it made my day. Thanks to the crew."
220,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a flight from Bucharest to London and return and when we were at the airport, they informed us that the flight will be delayed for 5 hours (from 8am to 1pm), then another 1 hour and a half (until 2:30 pm). We lost the money we paid for the bus tickets and they would not refund. Returning to Bucharest our flight was delayed and they did not  inform us about it. I understand that unforeseen situation can happen, but I have never seen such a poorly prepared company in my life."
221,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Calgary. Thank you to James, a Club World flight attendant on BA 0103 April 15, 2019. His service was impeccable, attentive and delightful. I thoroughly enjoyed the flight. "
222,"✅ Trip Verified |  Vancouver to London, we were upgraded to business class at the airport. The staff were absolutely delightful and had a fabulous trip. Really they could not have been more helpful and I would recommend them. "
223,"Not Verified |  
Miami to London Heathrow with British Airways. Top deck of 747 with one experienced and one new crew members. Perfect welcome and appreciated the method of selecting what and when to have for breakfast. Had a starter and then settled down and slept better than expected. On-time arrival and AA Arrivals lounge was quiet with good showers."
224,"✅ Trip Verified |  Houston to London. The plane left an hour late while an engineer dealt with a problem. I’ve no problem with that, I like travelling safely. I thought, well I’m sure I’d booked an aisle seat online but it appears it was a window. I missed out on the airline meal and when I realised I buzzed the steward and requested a sandwich and water, explaining the problem. He fetched me a sandwich and various bits he’d scrabbled together from the kitchen. Later when the liquid refreshment cane round, both my neighbour and I requested water and I had to reach across him for my drink as he helped himself to his drink and left me to it."
225,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Delhi. The worst business class trip for us. Seats much smaller than business class on Singapore Air, Thai International, Eva Air, Qantas; Not seated together - same surname, Mr and Mrs - but moved after. No privacy on middle seats; one tiny drawer is only storage for shoes, iPad, makeup and sponge bag, book etc. Film/TV selection was very limited and my choice wasn’t working. The food was very poor - main course congealed and so basic with a dessert that was pathetic, no tea, coffee, or chocolates offered to us. Breakfast had no jam with the croissant. Nobody came round during the flight offering extra water or other beverages. The crew didn’t put themselves out. If one pays more for business class one expects more and we didn’t get it. I would never choose to travel BA again."
226,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bucharest to London. My flight with British Airways was 7 hours delayed (from a European destination to London). I applied for compensation for this delay. Initially I was informed that under EU regulations I would receive 400 Euros compensation, to be informed 4 days later that this was an error and that I was no longer getting compensated. British Airways argued that sickness of a crew member is considered extraordinary circumstances (comparable with weather issues) and that therefore, they do not have to compensate passengers for this flight. However, there are court precedence cases that clearly show that crew sickness is not to be considered an extraordinary circumstance and that it is in an airlines responsibility to have a contingency strategy for such cases or compensate if they do not. I have talked to the manager of customer service and was told that there is nothing they can do as this is their policy. I believe that, if not on legal basis, British Airways should have compensated out of customer service reasons because a 7 hour delay (within Europe) is significant. Many times I picked to fly with British Airways based on the expectations of good customer service in the case of anything going wrong. But this experience proved to me that it's not worth investing that extra money into flying with British Airways."
227,✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Bengaluru. I found the crew very friendly and even humorous! Whenever the airhostesses passed through the aisle (I was on a seat next to the aisle) we would exchange some friendly comments which almost always lead to muffled laughs!  One air hostess admitted that she enjoyed such conversations which made the stress of her work lighter! 
228,"Not Verified |  Madrid to London. We paid for business class and then paid for specific seats. The original booking was from Iberia (part of IAG which operates BA, Iberia and Air lingus) BA clearly do not integrate into Iberia's systems since after paying for and closing our seats, upon checking in we found our seats had been changed by BA (these flights were operated by Iberia and BA, BA being the return leg from Madrid to London Heathrow). BA explained that they would have to check if we were due a refund - total joke since we paid for the seats. Additionally the BA said the flight was full and could not change the seats. No explanation as to why we paid for specific seats in business and they were changed by BA without notice. We'll accept the refund on this occasion since there is nothing else we can do and never use BA or Iberia again which is a shame since Iberia CS has always reflected all and IAG / BA has let the customer down, again. Just simply poor BA  and low bar as always, expected more for full fare business class. Rated 1/10 since as we were let down and did not receive an explanation and were initially told that we would not get a refund on the paid for allocated seats!"
229,✅ Trip Verified |  Dublin to London Heathrow. British Airways offered a very good overall service on this flight. I booked online and found that process very easy. The caveat was not being able to select the seat I wanted ahead of travel without paying another fee. The check-in lady was very friendly and helpful and gave a good account of herself. The flight departed on-time and the captain made frequent announcements. Within the previous two weeks I had flown with BA twice within Europe and this flight was by the best of the 3 thanks to the staff. The flight was relatively short but well managed with a nice drop down map and staff visibly make a real effort. One curiosity was the staff handing out UK landing cards The flight was punctual and reliable.
230,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Seattle. My seat was on the upper deck, a nice perk for Seattle flights to Europe (BA is the only one flying 747s to Europe from Seattle). Overall the product is outdated. Service was not at the level it used to be. Staff is polite and professional but they keep the service to a minimum.  Upper deck crew on this flight was mainly uninterested except the bare minimum.  No additional service, no top ups, not offering water during the flight. Of course if you ask for something you do get it. There was also a lot of traffic on the stairway connecting upper and lower deck with the crew congregating at the lower deck.  I hope BA will improve their act. I certainly won’t use their services in foreseeable future."
231,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Gibraltar. Check in at T3 was fine, lounge was good and staff were more proactive than was previously the case. Flight was good with decent lunch served including the kids meals which were fine. Skilled landing in Gibraltar- a good flight"
232,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Boston. BA replaced A380 with a very old Boeing 747. Video system did not work for more than 1 hour, then work for a few hours and stopped working. No WIFI, very old plane. Service OK. Not good for business traveling."
233,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Doha. Similar to our outbound flight, the seats are comfortable but behind the competition, very small storage area , if you are tall try sleeping sitting up or in the cradle position as the bed is just not long enough. The food portions seems like you are forced to go on a diet, though the taste was ok. The entertainment system had the worst selection of any airline I have flown lately - but their check in baggage policy makes them a very attractive option when you see what their opposition charges for excess luggage."
234,"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Houston. Despite sitting at the back of the plane we were really well looked after. Without exception all of the staff in this cabin were exceptionally friendly and professional. They really seemed to be enjoying their work. Lunch and a pre landing snack were provide together with an ice cream mid flight. Commendably, even in these days of austerity, my pre lunch gin was served with Fever Tree tonic. Well done BA. Frequent drinks runs were made. Despite its age the Jumbo was well turned out internally. The only downside was because of Air Traffic issues at Heathrow the flight arrived late. This meant that we almost missed our connecting domestic flight. This was mainly down to tardy Immigration procedures, the need to pick up our bags and transfer to another terminal for our ongoing flight. All very stressful."
235,Not Verified |  Larnaca to London. This A320 is totally unsuitable for a flight of this length. The seat pitch and width are the same for economy and club. Having paid €1000 for my flight it's disgraceful on flight where you are sitting for more than 5 hours in an expensive Club Europe seat the personal space is so tight. If the person in front reclined their seat it's a nightmare. The seat in the middle is blocked but getting out if the seats in front are reclined is hazardous.  You pay for a Club ticket for space and comfort and get nothing. 
236,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked my BA flight from Zurich to London Heathrow using Avios, my frequent flyer number had to be added 3 times during the booking process. When I tried to reserve an aisle seat (for medical reasons) the BA website showed that all of the seats had been allocated save for a few seats for which I would have had to pay about thirty pounds. The check-in area for BA at Zurich airport is in a hard to find spot of the airport. The check-in agent was very professional, helpful and informative. The area of departure from Zurich was by transfer train. The flight boarded in an orderly manner and left more or less on time. I was dismayed to see cabin crew serve alcohol to a group of already drunk German speaking sports fans. One of the cabin crew declared that she had run out of beer and then suggested to an increasingly loud and aggressive man that he might like the cider instead. In the meantime the same crew members ignored me and other passengers while offering the trolley service. The overhead maps were not used and the captain made minimal announcements during the flight none of which were in German. The flight arrived reasonably promptly."
237,✅ Trip Verified |  The booking process was easy enough but they have reduced the baggage allowance in terms of the seats one can book. The cost of including a bag added considerably to the cheapest fare. Check-in was well managed and it was good to see passengers with too much luggage required to check their bags in. Departure was well managed and although there was a delay the captain communicated well. My gripe is that my seat was dirty and the window was also dirty.  Some of the to buy M&S food items were not available and the lavatory I used was dirty. The staff were very professional and pleasant and the drop-down route map was nice especially for the younger passengers to enjoy. Hardworking crew.
238,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Tokyo Narita. Had a fantastic flight in the new BA First cabin on the Boeing 787. On both journeys the crew were outstanding as was the food and the service. The food was of high end restaurant standard, the seat comfortable."
239,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bridgetown to London Gatwick. Paid for a Business Class flight. The onboard service was abysmal. No refreshments offered on boarding. Dinner took three hours to be served (on a night flight). My Husband had to go to the Galley twice for his dinner requests, he’d been forgotten. I requested ‘Express’ service, which didn’t happen. Website advertises ‘Premium Levels of Service’ and ‘Every Journey Unique and Unforgettable.’ The service was dreadful, but the journey was definitely unforgettable for the wrong reasons. Don’t waste your money with this airline, you don’t get what you pay for and they try to compensate by offering loyalty points, and telling you that you don’t pay for the Service, that the extra costs are for taxes, the Lounge and extra loyalty points. All BA could respond with was a goodwill gesture of loyalty points. Really?"
240,"✅ Trip Verified |  St Lucia to Gatwick on which my wife and I were both involuntarily downgraded from Premium Economy to Economy due overbooking on the flight. It should be noted that at no time was there any announcement for volunteers for downgrading at Vieux Fort Airport. I now know from your cabin crew that it is normal practice for appeals for volunteers to be put over the tannoy system before any enforced downgrades. At the time of going through the baggage hall getting our boarding passes we queried them as none had seat numbers on them to which we were told to just to go through security and our seats would be allocated when we went through the departure gate. Once in the departure lounge all four of us were tannoyed to return to the baggage hall when we were then told that my wife and I were being downgraded to economy. The male telling us this more or less indicated this was the only way we would be getting on the flight giving us £75 per each on a prepayment card as compensation under Article 7.3 of EC 261/2004 stating however that this did not affect our statutory rights. He then told us he would find us in the departure lounge and then all four of us had to go through security once again. The male who we spoke to in the baggage hall did not come and find us, we had to go and find him when he also told me that he had put my wife and I on a row with no other passengers which we assumed, rightly or wrongly, was so we could not tell people sitting beside us about the poor service we had received from BA. However two other passengers did come and sit beside us with the passenger sitting beside my wife telling her this was because the seat they had been allocated was soaking wet and smelt of urine and the cabin crew had asked them to sit on it with a cushion which they had refused and so they were given the seats next to us which was no problem. What further concerned me even more was one of your cabin crew walking past another passenger with their seat in the reclined position on three separate occasions just prior to approaching Gatwick and after the Pilot had requested seat belts on and seats in upright positions, never telling the passenger to raise their seat. BA’s latest advert celebrates 100 years of BA but for me their service is going backwards. The music that accompanies the advert is called ‘Salvation’ and by the end of the flight my wife and I were surely seeking it. Article 10 of EC Regulation 261/2004 is worth reading if this happens to you."
241,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to London. Cancelled flights just a few hours before I left home, then put me on a different flight which would have made it impossible to make my connecting flight. Was finally put on a different flight. On the way home, because my first flight was through American Airlines, and the second through British Airways (all in the same booking), I was only able to check in and get a seat on the American Airlines flight, as I was redirected every time to their website. Couldn’t check in for the British Airways flight so had to have a middle seat which is very uncomfortable. I always check in 24 hours before to guarantee a seat, but BA wouldn’t allow me to do this."
242,✅ Trip Verified |  London to Bangalore. This was the worst experience. I flew with my infant daughter ande cabin crew was extremely rude. I was surprised that there was no way to heat milk for my daughter. I found the food portions so meagre. Not sufficient for a child also.  British Airways is sad in every sense of the term.
243,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hamburg to Abu Dhabi via Heathrow. The 1.5h flight from Hamburg to Heathrow was like flying a budget carrier. No free service at all, everything has to be purchased at inflated prices. Heathrow T5 the usual chaos. I can use the F Lounge due to my One World status. Massive lounge, crowded with the charm and food quality of a Cafeteria. Toilets filthy. One of the worst lounges I’ve seen. Boarding orderly and well organized. Boeing 788 IFE screen broken. Seats very uncomfortable and narrow. Service and food quality average. Flight Abu Dhabi to Heathrow delayed by almost an hour due to late arrival of the flight crew, this is something I have never experieinced before. Rest of the journey uneventful. Overall a rather disappointing experience. BA cannot compete with the Middle Eastern carriers."
244,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Seville. Following on from mistakenly booking a return flight with BA despite having a previous confirmed booking with a competitor, I quickly called up BA to resolve the issue. They understood the problem and gave me a full refund. The agent was exceptionally helpful on the phone and provided me a quick answer and solution to the problem. I don’t believe most airlines would have accepted my reasoning, however it’s great to see BA treat their customers with care."
245,"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha to Paris via London. This is the first time using BA since October 2002, nothing has changed,  the same reversible business class seats with very little storage space still comfortable but the business has caught up with BA and left them behind, with very poor entertainment selection and limited food choice. It cannot compare with other business leaders like Cathay and Qatar Airways but on this route BA charges the same price as Qatar Airways but delivers a much poorer product, though the service was OK not as personal but alright. Where they are better is with their check in luggage policy of 2 bags 32 kgs each they are superior and generous. I will still use them but look forward to them rolling in the new business class."
246,"✅ Trip Verified |  Madrid to London BA0457 on the 18/03. Couldn't have been a better service. Long time since I flew Club Europe but it was an amazing experience. The welcome aboard was excellent and so was the service and food. Stephen, one of the flight attendants was so attentive and happy to help that he probably made it the best short haul flight experience I have had in a long time. Well done to the crew on that flight!"
247,"✅ Trip Verified | On the flight to Tokyo, I was separated from my wife even though it was our honeymoon. Thanks. The return felt like a 12 hour easyJet flight. One meal and one half meal. Limited drinks. Very small seats. I’m 5 foot 9 and my knees touched the seat in front. Very, very mediocre."
248,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Vancouver. Check in agent very helpful in searching out seat options. Very smooth process. The disappointment was the receptionist at the Galleries Lounge at T3 who was rude and unhelpful. All was redeemed once on board. The crew were excellent throughout the flight in the best British Airways tradition - friendly, helpful and attentive. Food not great but on a par with economy in other airlines. Wines better than many airlines. The aircraft was clean and reasonably well maintained for an older 747-400. IFE selection good."
249,"✅ Trip Verified | The First Class zone at Heathrow T5 and the Concorde Lounge are very good. Service on board was excellent in both directions. The cabin layout is unimpressive and the food is nothing to write home about. The screen is small, with poor resolution. I enjoyed the flights in both directions, mainly because of the service. This First does not compare well with that of Middle Eastern and Asian airlines, but BA business class is so poor, I either fly economy or (when I am very lucky) try to fly First."
250,✅ Trip Verified |  I had a miserable experience in first class from London to Chicago. I had requested a special meal but that was not available. When I complained to customer relations they simply said too bad and insulted me by offering 10 K miles. The bathroom lacked amenities and i found the service was barebones. The angled suite is not private and when i stretched my feet hit a metal band in the middle of the foot rest. Video screen is small and must be stowed away 20 min before landing. Cabin crew never asked what I wanted and were only available when you press the call button. In flight entertainment is poor. 
251,✅ Trip Verified |  Leeds Bradford to Las Vegas via Heathrow. Customer services handling of my question never answered it. Three times I asked them to explain why the cost of my one checked bag caused the fare to increase over £100 on the outbound flight. This was before any increase other than the increase announced for the short LBA LHR fare. I asked why the fare was so much when I could have booked a seat for the bag for about £50. The response was we are doing what everyone else is doing. They never could explain why the fare increased by over £100 when I indicated one checked bag. I asked to speak with someone but that was never responded to. Book LHR LAS at that time and one bag included. Customer service apparently did not understand what I was asking because the answer provided was non-responsive. 
252,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas to London Heathrow in First Class. This is the worst experience I have had on a flight. The crew was indifferent and unresponsive, and treated you more like you were a nuisance to them. There was even less service from this so called first class crew than you get in tourist class in most airlines. The attitude and service of the crew was abysmal. When you have average food and wine on offer and a rather outdated cabin in first class, at least you should prioritize service as your competitive advantage to your full paying customers. This was nothing but a waste of money. I doubt very much I will go back to British Airways again."
253,"✅ Trip Verified |  Tenerife to Heathrow. Effectively a budget airline masquerading at premium airline prices. Have flown several budget airlines in the past which have offered far more in terms of value for money and service. Seats are rigid and I felt as if I was leaning forward for the the majority of the flight. When I tried to put my seat back to recline, I estimate it moved around 5 degrees. Leg room is also non existent. M&S food ran out halfway through the 5 hour flight and although cabin crew were apologetic, for food to run out during a lunchtime flight is inexcusable and highlights how badly the airline is being managed by the upper echelons. Furthermore, several other budget airlines at the airport had flights leaving directly from the terminal requiring no bussing of passengers. BA again in a move to save money opt for bussing passengers to the far reaches of the airport to avoid paying extra charges for utilising direct access from airport terminals. Can't fault the staff onboard who are clearly dedicated to the BA brand. They are professional, friendly and courteous. It's clear that British Airways are not the airline they once were and I hope that passengers begin to vote with their feet as drastic changes are needed to bring the airline back to its former glory."
254,"✅ Trip Verified | Heathrow to Larnaca - departed on time, flight nearly full. M&S food available to passengers ran out while cabin crew were half way down the aisle. Larnaca to Heathrow - two messages received while in Larnaca airport - the flight would be delayed by over an hour-departure was supposed to be at 7.15 pm but we took off nearer to 9 pm. The second message was that there was no food to be served on the flight, ""we recognise that this does not meet with the standards you expect from us"". The flight was 5 hours long-so this combination of a delayed departure and no food available on board is totally unacceptable - worse than a budget airline. A midnight arrival at Heathrow was then compounded by off loading cargo before the passengers because of a ""balance problem"". In addition I was incorrectly charged Eur 75 on the return leg for my case - it was clearly the same case that I travlled out to Cyprus with but the system identified it as extra baggage. Cattle class is an under rated description of the service offered to customers. The only saving grace was the cabin crew-particularly the Customer Service Manager-who promised to follow up the baggage issue and logged my complaint. It will take ages to resolve but he was helpful and pleasant throughout. How British Airways can offer such a poor product and expect people to keep flying with them is beyond me."
255,"✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to London. A very enjoyable and comfortable flight on the new recliner seat set up on the 787. BA have raised their game and provides a superior seat to make for a relaxed flight . If you are travelling solo a retractable divider gives you privacy from your neighbour. Only problem is the 2x3x2 layout is one too many seats across, as it leaves two very narrow gangways; if you have an aisle seat in the ""turn right"" section in Business Class you will be constantly whacked unintentionally(?) by Economy section passengers with their carry-ons when boarding. Food and drinks were excellent, with courses served separately and the wine bottle frequently produced by flight attendants who gave a great service to their passengers. Entertainment choice also excellent with a film choice for everyone. Thanks also to two people most of us forget - the flight crew who got us safely to Heathrow 15 minutes early and put the plane down so gently we hardly noticed we had arrived! Well done BA for providing such a good product and service."
256,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Phoenix, BA289 yesterday. The plane was supposed to land at 1835. However, it landed at 1940. Because of this I missed my connecting flight to Ontario, California aboard American Airlines. By the time I was able to go through custom and pick up my luggage, it was already 2030. The flight departs at 2037. I went to the ground crew of American Airlines, they told me that I will not be able to make it to my connecting flight as they are already on the runway. They then directed me to British Airways. I went to the ground attendant of British Airways and she told me to go back to American Airlines to get it re booked. I went back to American Airlines then they told me again to back to British Airways since they are they the one who caused the delay. I went back to British Airways with the American Airlines supervisor. The British Airways attendant gave me a card with the customer service number and told me to call them in the morning. She did not offer any explanations or anything. American Airlines said we can re booked it for tomorrow morning but they did not offer any accommodation. I ended up getting my own car rental and drove from Phoenix to California in the middle of the night since I was not able to resolve this issues with both airlines."
257,"✅ Trip Verified |  San Francisco to London. After paying £4000 for flights which I had to cancel, they wouldn't allow any change of dates or change of name, and after all that wouldn't give me the  Avios points because I wont be on the flight."
258,"✅ Trip Verified |  Rome to London. One of the best European airlines to travel with for short haul flights. The online website is very clear and easy to use. Check-in procedure was smooth. The gate was very close to the shopping area. Boarding the flight was very well organised and quick and through the airbridge. The only negative aspect is that you will need to pay for a drink, as they don’t serve anything free on all European routes."
259,"✅ Trip Verified |  Cologne to Gatwick in economy class with an silver status BA card. No online check-in available.  BA website suggests passenger to arrive at the airport 3 hours before flight departure but airport check-in (the only available option) starts 2 hours before departure. No lounge available (there is a lounge in the terminal open to other airline customers, except BA). No priority boarding for Business and elite level passengers. Boarding the plane by bus. Not even free water on board in economy."
260,"✅ Trip Verified |  Tampa to Gatwick. I paid to have my seats bumped up to business class and when I got to the airport they wouldn't let me on the flight because someone on their side messed up when they booked my seats, so instead of honoring my seats they just sat there for an hour telling me they can't do anything and I can't get on the plane. They waited till the very last second before the check in period closed to reissue my tickets and won't reimburse me for the seats that I paid for, but never received. "
261,"✅ Trip Verified | London Heathrow to Madrid. I travel from LHR regularly. British Airways have proved to be reliable and their service is of good quality. As a frequent traveler, I've been able to use the priority boarding and also managed to get exit row seats. This airline is very good with providing tangible benefits to silver members. The lounge at Heathrow Terminal 5 is also very good and provides a good selection of food and refreshments. The bar is very well stocked and also a good selection of soft drinks available. I'm very happy with the airline service and would definitely recommend British Airways. Keep it up guys."
262,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to St Lucia return. Recently returned from a two week holiday with my wife in Caribbean for a 60th birthday celebration. Tickets bought in August 2018 and decided to spoil ourselves with a Club Class return, having flown out Premium Economy. Arrived at airport to be told that we'd been downgraded to Premium Economy due to overbooking. Apologetic ground staff (defending the indefensible) but no apology on the plane. Fuming all the way back to London, exacerbated by hopeless cabin staff service (tea when I asked for coffee) and filthy food. Complained on return through BA exec Club webiste with response from Customer Service 10 days later. BA claims that overbooking is a very rare occurrence and gave a lukewarm apology. Evidence from ground staff on both journeys contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak season. We booked early so probably had relatively cheap seats. BA has presumably made money by selling our tickets to a higher bidder. General quality of BA service, food and wine has fallen dramatically over the last few years. BA is now effectively a low cost airline, flying a fleet of very tired aircraft, trying to preserve the gloss of a quality airline. The accountants may win in the short term but passengers will vote with their feet. Avoid this airline if you possible can. And the final insult in booking premium seats with BA is that you get charge £40 to pre reserve in Club and £70 in Premium Economy. BA, you are having a laugh with the flying public. On this performance you don't deserve to stay in business."
263,"✅ Trip Verified |  It's been many years since I flew long haul British Airways and I was pleasantly surprised by recent flights. BA staff used to be offhand and inhospitable but that's all changed. From the time of arriving at London Heathrow T5 the staff have been really friendly and helpful. Similarly on the flight, the attendants couldn't do enough for me. When I requested tomato juice with Worcester sauce, the attendant made a special trip to the rear to get it. On the way back I asked for a tonic water and, again, they offered to go and get it. The seating of these newer planes allows me knee room, even though I'm 6ft 3ins and the headrest can be slid up high enough too. The entertainment system, though a little quirky in its operation and menu system compared to the slickness of Cathay Pacific, nevertheless had a good range of movies and TV to watch. Both flights ended up arriving on time, despite delays at Heathrow both ways, and the pilots kept us cheerfully informed as what was going on. Food quality was reasonable, again not up to the standard of Cathay Pacific, rather let down by a filled croissant for breakfast which I thought was a bit mean. Overall a very pleasant flight, thanks BA. Is this because competition is hotting up and BA now have to try harder?"

London Heathrow / Pisa return. My wife and I fly this route 3-4 times a year as we have a home in Tuscany. Sometimes we pay in long advance to get a decent price, or we pay using Avios. This return trip was the latter. It is what it is. The most miserable rip off for a business class seat in the world. I have seen last minute flights on this route as high as £700 return. BA should be ashamed of themselves. The only reason we fly this product is that you get the business class lounges in both directions. The seating is at the front of the plane for a speedy exit. The new meals are quite good and the free (is it really free?) booze. The seats are the biggest con. Three seats for two - with a dumb table in the middle. Unless you are in the front row the leg room is a disaster. On the way out we had a nice tomato and mozzarella salad + wine. On the way back - a ploughman's lunch, it was okay-ish. As a 60 year old businessman, one who has worked globally in my career in the US, Japan and the Middle East - and having sold my business a few years ago, to one of the largest PLCs in the country - I think I know a bit about running companies. I know I could do a lot better than the current board at BA. Last week when I was away, I read that BA have posted well in excess of one billion profits last year. Oh, what a surprise and that's the clear objective of the directors. So what would I do with Club Europe? I'd make it the best in Europe. The seat would be larger, like an arm chair. A 2+2 configuration. There would be a nice centre table. Charge ports for phones/laptops. Headsets. TV screens mainly for news - but some movies for flights over 2 hours. Extra 6"" of leg room behind row ""1"". Nice cutlery and glass/china ware. Hot meals. And i'd probably sell it at £25 a flight more. ""Build value guys"" and the profits will follow. Its the oldest dictum in the book. I will give credit where credit is due. On the way back, on the ground, the Captain announced there was possible a technical problem with the starboard aileron. As an aviation buff I loseley understood the problem and figured it was not really a big deal. Clearly some passengers were worried we were on a duff plane. He picked up on that and took the initiative to take a relaxed walk, the length of plane, asking if anyone had concerns or questions. One or two did and he answered their concerns in a calm and thoughtful way and explained he was only taking a precautionary measure. Very nice chap. We took off 2 hours later when it was fixed and everything was fine. FAs in both directions were very good."
265,✅ Trip Verified | Edinburgh to Boston via London. The planes are ancient and need to be replaced. If these were cars they would have an antique plate. The seats are uncomfortable and worn. There is no lumbar support. The space between the seatback in front and your face is inches. It’s really claustrophobic. The food is awful and last evening we were not offered a choice. So for $1200 each we had horrible seats and terrible food. The short connecting flights do not even offer bottled water. The M&S menu is expensive and offers limited choices. Meal deals in the airport convenience and drug stores offer much better options for less than half the price. The planes on both long legs of the trip last week were filthy. The cabin crew on the BOS to LHR and LHR to EDI were good. There was one member in the LHR to BOS who was snippy to passengers and seemed put out by needing to do her job. Boarding is supposed to be by group but was a disaster as people queued up well before their section was called and it made it extremely difficult to get to board. British Airways has become like a budget airline who does not charge budget pricing.
266,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Mauritius. My wife and 2 friends booked and paid £56 each to select our seats with additional legroom adjacent to the bassinet stowage. On boarding the flight the configuration of the aircraft differed, meaning we had the same seat row and number but without the additional legroom. My formal complaint to BA has been met with what can only be described as condescending platitudes and a blank refusal to refund our seat booking fee. We feel that this a scam and are continuing to pursue the matter. Trading standards are also being informed. It didn’t help the aircraft was delayed by 4 hours on the outward leg, was filthy dirty. The return flight had numerous IFE defects and my seat recline did not work. I also noted a number of cabin minor airworthiness issues, (I am a licensed engineer). A marketing email in celebration of 100 years of service has thanked me for flying hundreds of thousands of miles with BA and then rips me off with nothing in return. British Airways you are a disgrace, get your act together and provide the service you were once famed for."
267,"Not Verified |  Flew out of Heathrow on 22nd Feb to New York, 20 mins into our flight and we noticed our Tv's weren't working (4 travellers) but I have to say the cabin crew managed to reset them and they we were working within the hour. The reason for reviewing this is how wonderful the crew were. The crew on this flight were amazing, nothing was too much trouble. Thank you to all involved on that flight."
268,"✅ Trip Verified |  Horrible flight BA from Gatwick to Cape Town and Iberia on the return. I am only 5'2"" 8st 10 and I find the leg room too cramp. The onboard flight entertainment system was down on the BA flight most of the time. It was probably in the last 2 hours of the flight before they managed to fix it and the system was old fashioned and movies were streamed on a loop. The food was barely edible. Coming back on Iberia the entertainment system was better and the food was also better but the seats legroom was just as bad. I was almost bumped off my connecting flight at MAD due to the lockers being filled up. I had another connection to make at LHR and I was not going to miss that so I had to insist they let me on though loads of other passengers were led off. This was the worst flight I have flown on. Last long haul BA flight for me."
269,"✅ Trip Verified |  New York to Venice via London. Staff have been nice when around but aircraft, food, assistance and information all deplorable. Booked Business class. First flight, overnight from JFK to Heathrow - quick, mediocre food service then gone. Chair is set up so I’m staring at a stranger, it’s uncomfortable and difficult to maneuver with no instructions. Didn’t wake me for breakfast, not sure why they had me fill in a form for when I wanted to be woken up. No instructions for the transition between BA flights. Now I’m on the flight from Heathrow to Venice, no offer of coffee, water but worse, business class is just coach class, no extra leg room, just 3 seats with the middle one blocked out. Person in front of me put their seat back and my knees are in my chest. I didn’t pay for international business class to get stuck in uncomfortable seats for 2 long flights. I won’t fly BA again. "
270,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to London Heathrow. Club Class on British Airways is without doubt the worst in the airline industry.  It is bad enough that BA persist using out of date airplanes, circa 25 year old B747-400's, but they perpetuate the dreadful ying/yang seating arrangement of Club Class, where you have to look directly at the passenger next to you, and raise a screen for privacy. Then, mid-flight the crew lower the screen to serve the food. To leave the seat, one has to climb over the legs of a sleeping passenger;~no mean feat in the dark. The crew from Chicago were appalling, and dumped the food upon us as quickly as possible. Breakfast was inedible, and I returned it uneaten. The lounge at O'Hare was a crowded, tiny, dirty facility, with a food bar including some wilted vegetables and crackers with cheese. Insufficient chairs, and a single, old TV. Does no one at BA care how BAD they have become for premium class passengers."
271,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Chicago. Could it get any worse? The flight to Chicago was equipped with the usual ancient Boeing 747-400. The British Airways First Class product doesn't come up to modern Business Class standards. This particular flight was late again, and the food / wine was simply awful. There is nothing remotely elegant about BA First Class, and the crew demonstrate no sophistication. This experience was like dining at your worst restaurant chain. Finally, not only is the aircraft tired and worn out, but the in flight so-called entertainment system did not work, and had to be rebooted twice. The First Class seat is a bad joke, and extraordinarily uncomfortable. British Airways are at least twenty years out of date with their entire First Class product. All that can be said about this airline is woeful. The Concorde First Class lounge at Heathrow is filthy dirty, and desperately needs refurbishment."
272,"✅ Trip Verified |  Prague to London Heathrow. Very disappointing service. Cabin crew only managed to offer drinks to half the cabin, on a two hour flight that was already delayed - payment machine was broken, staff ran backwards and forwards as nothing seemed available on the trolley. On the bright said, I did save by not having to pay the over inflated prices."
273,"✅ Trip Verified |  London City to Florence. My flight was at around 7am in the morning. Not only it got canceled 3 hours before but at the moment there was no phone line open to call and manage a rebooking. On their site I had the option to reschedule my flight but I couldn’t select any flights on the same day. Interestingly i was able to find & book another one through Skyscanner again with BA at the day of my initial flight with £100 more, of course. Why couldn’t they simple show me this flight on the reschedule page? "
274,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Johannesburg. Since the aircraft was half full, I was looking for a great flight. We left on time, and that was the only positive point. I started watching a movie, and a young flight attendant  approached and asked for my dinner choice. I told her that I would love a G&T to start with, and then I will read the menu. She told me that this was a late evening departure (9pm is not late for me) and that no pre-dinner drinks would be served. I insisted (this is business class after all, half full flight). 30 minutes later, she brought a tray with everything on it (G&T, first dish, main dish, and dessert).  Never was I offered wine or coffee. The lights were turned off, and I did not see a flight attendant until 1:30 hours before landing.  Other passengers in business where treated the same and complained."
275,"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha to London Heathrow. Flight on time, not completely full, had an aisle seat near back of plane without the entertainment box in the way. Some reviews say that the last few windows are blanked off at rear of the aircraft but not so on this plane. Breakfast was served which was OK. Cabin crew mixed, mostly young and worked quickly. Crew uniform still looks a bit tatty compared with rivals in this part of the world. There is good and bad still with BA - bad was the so called chicken wrap served just before arrival - leathery and inedible - why do they let themselves down with such a poor offering - hardly any passengers near me could eat it. Bad was that there was an old tissue and food wrapper in my seat pocket. Good was the newer aircraft and the breakfast has improved. Arrived on time at Heathrow but to a remote stand."
276,"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to Tel Aviv via London. At Miami airport on October 2018 what a pleasure was dealing with the agent, so professional, nice and helpful to the every last detail. Now on February 2019 calling British Airways to redeem my Avios what another pleasure dealing with a patient, knowledgeable and nice agent. She explained everything in such detail. You are doing great with such fantastic employees. "
277,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Seoul. I normally fly business but this was a last minute flight and the cost of Club was prohibitive and so I thought I would give World Traveller Plus a go. The cabin is stylish and intimate and I was surprised how roomy and comfortable the seats were. The entertainment system was working well (although the adverts before every single showing are very annoying). I was happy with the headphones and small amenity kit and felt the staff were very welcoming. My only complaint was the slightly pointless menu we were given as for lunch neither of the meals listed were actually available. A similar thing happened with breakfast, three options, the third being the most appetizing, and no, it hadn't been loaded, so this is an area BA might want to look into. All in all the service was good and worth the price. For ground service BA, please at least keep a couple of desks for people to check into before automation puts us all out of work."
278,"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to New York JFK. Bag drop did not go well. Lounge (galleries north ) was good and not crowded. Boarding was fine, small delay, well organised. Pre take off drink was better than the one i got in club world 2 weeks previous. Main meal good, pre flight snack was average but my son really liked it. On time arrival, a good flight. Cabin crew included some of the older staff who are not mixed fleet crew and it stands out a mile. I thought this was a good flight."
279,"✅ Trip Verified | San Diego to London. From the moment that I boarded this flight (due to take off at 19.25), the crew had one interest and one only - to get the cabin lights off, which they duly achieved two hours later. As a consequence, the service was negligent in the extreme. This was a Club World ticket - so expensive and I looked forward to a decent level of service. However, I wasn't offered champagne on boarding, wine with my meal or coffee and port after my meal. I complained to BA when I got home but they weren't interested and I was met with a barrage of corporate platitudes. This flight was a disappointing end to what had been a great trip to the US & Mexico and has left me with a very poor view of the airline."
280,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to St Lucia. Flew BA new revamped business class today and a huge improvement on the old set up. Well lit cabin, improved seating comfort, better and operational entertainment system (always hit or miss before) and decent food. Cabin crew worked hard and were pleasant. I have observed along with everyone else the falling standards at BA and have moved most of my travel to rival airlines but on the basis of today’s experience I will consider them in the future. Much improved, well done."
281,✅ Trip Verified |  London to Chennai. It was amazing. The crew were very friendly. The food was amazing and the seats were comfortable. T was overall an amazing flight and I enjoyed it thoroughly.
282,"Not Verified |  London to Tampa. BA broke my suitcase and I did not make a fuss, I just got a new one. The new one was too large for the overhead bin on the return flight (the only suitcase I could purchase while abroad). So on top of the new suitcase, I had to actually pay BA to check the new bag. Cost me over $100 for their mistake. They also shovel off customer service to some company abroad. You will get an email a month later saying ""I'd like to know you that we are unable to offer refund"". Make a big fuss at the airport if they break your stuff so that you can avoid this black hole they call customer service.
"
283,"✅ Trip Verified |  My husband and I flew on British Airways flight BA-228 from Baltimore to London Heathrow leaving on the 12th February 2019. Every aspect of the flight was poorer than what budget airlines have to offer. The plane was shabby and dated. The seat reclining facility did not operate properly, was not that comfortable, and we had less legroom than the equivalent with budget airlines. The touch screen TV monitor was not working properly. One ear bud on the headphones did not work. The audio socket was too loose for the headphones so the plug kept falling out making it difficult to enjoy the in-flight entertainment (which in itself had a dated choice). The pillow was disgusting and kept falling out of the flimsy cover. The air conditioning lacked consistency alternating between very hot and very cold air. The restroom occupied sign always lit up as vacant even if it was occupied. However what made the flight very unpleasant was the bad attitude of the cabin crew. They were abrupt, unfriendly and quite clearly did not want to be there. There was one exception, an extremely pleasant older crew member who greeted us on and off the flight. There did not appear to be any organisation or smooth co-ordination when distributing the meals. Our two trays of food where placed on top of each other and practically thrown at us by a sour faced crew member. This flight was one hour late making us nervous about catching our connecting flight. There was no information or instructions given to us about connecting flight gate numbers before we landed. Unlike all the other airlines that I have travelled with there were no staff member greeting the connecting customers to point them in the right direction or re-assure them. British Airways would be my last choice of an airline to travel with and I would only fly with them again if there was no other option."
284,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bridgetown to Gatwick. I couldn't imagine that first class on BA would be the same as travelling in business class with for example Qatar, Emirates, Etihad, Singapore, Thai etc for double the price. Cabin, seats and food equals business class. One of the red wines on the wine list was out from start when I left London outbound. Cabin crew worked well and gave splendid service. But first class on BA is not worth the fare. When I complained to customer service after I got home, all I got was they are in the process of upgrading world traveller. "
285,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Athens. Classic BA love and hate relationship where one flight is perfect and another one is a total disaster. Problems in December 2018 at Heathrow check-in when BA check-in and baggage management IT systems went down for at least 90 minutes. Total chaos with people like myself arrived at the airport 2:30 hours before the flight and queuing while others arriving 45 minutes prior to their departure and given priority. Even though we were checked in at some point, the flight was delayed by 2+ hours on top of the problems. Then flight does not have enough food onboard. At least the crew clearly attempted to reduce flight time to the minimum."
286,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a British Airways flight from Amsterdam to London Heathrow. In the beginning everything went normal and smooth. Check-in and boarding was easy and on time and once everyone boarded the problems started one after another. First an announcement was made by the pilot about a flight delay due to strong winds in Heathrow (fair enough). Afterwards the wind problem was resolved but a passenger decided to leave so they had to take out his luggage. After that we received a 3rd announcement stating there is a computer malfunction at Schiphol Airport and they are doing their best to resolve it. This caused us already about 45-60 mins delay but me and other passenger still remained calm and relaxed and then the hell started. We received permission to take off after 7 mins and then the pilot offered passengers who do not wish to travel to leave the plane. Of course there were many passengers who were travelling on business and I guess too delayed to make it on time for their meetings so they decided to leave. The crew warned them that this might cause terrible delay and problems for the other passengers but they still decided to leave. So a group of passengers left and we missed our opportunity to take off. Then the pilot announced that we can take off after 2,5 or 3 hours. The flight was full of overseas travellers. We spent 2 hours sitting in a plane which was not moving anywhere, people unboarded the plane 4 times in total and no food or water was offered to us. We had to line up next to the bathroom to purchase food and drinks and pay for it. The overall experience was terrible and it ruined the whole plan for my first day in London."
287,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flying premium economy on British Airways from New Orleans to London was an absolute pleasure. The nine hour flight was an amazing experience, with great legroom, reclining seat for a nice sleep and low noise. Definitely recommend and will be flying premium on long haul again."
288,"✅ Trip Verified |  Tokyo to London. I was looking forward to this flight because of the Club World ticket and because it was my first time flying on a Boeing 787. We had a good check-in experience, breezed through the airport and enjoyed the JAL Lounge at Narita. We boarded on time and first impressions of the Boeing 787 were good: a modern plane with nice mood lighting as we boarded. The food and wines were really good. I had a beautifully-presented Japanese starter followed by a bento-style lunch as a final reminder of the holiday and my wife chose the western options. There was plenty of choice on the IFE and there was a big screen. On the downside, the cabin was too hot which made it difficult to sleep on the flight. This was a problem that we encountered on our outbound journey too. The seat was comfortable and reclined fully but I find the layout of BA Club World a little awkward because you have to step over another passenger's footrest to access the aisle. The cabin crew were efficient but seemed a bit exhausted and could have been more friendly and welcoming. The context to this review is that we spoiled ourselves and flew in first class on the way to Tokyo. We had an amazing experience with such comfortable seats and exemplary service from the cabin crew. We both felt a bit disappointed with the return flight in comparison and felt there was room for improvement, but at the same time our expectations might have been too high because of the previous flight."
289,✅ Trip Verified |  London to Tokyo Haneda. My wife and I treated ourselves to first class flights for our holiday to Japan with the help of my Avios and a BA Amex companion voucher. We were very excited about flying first class and the dedicated check-in area at Heathrow was great. We boarded on time and the cabin did not disappoint. We had very grand seats with lovely surroundings. The cabin staff who looked after us were fantastic and really took the time to get to know us and understand what we wanted. The food and alcoholic drinks were great. I went for beef main course followed by the amazing chocolate and toffee pudding. I was ready to sleep after all that food but saw that there was lots of choice and a large screen for the IFE. My wife and I both said afterwards that it didn't feel like a long-haul flight because the time passed so quickly and comfortably. My only complaint is that the cabin was uncomfortably hot while we were cruising which made it harder to sleep.
290,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was flying London to Billund today via British Airways and I was a bit hesitant as I’ve never flown with this airline, due to early morning traffic I was running a little behind schedule and I had a 23kg bag to also check in and check in closed 45 mins before my flight departs. Upon arrival I was greeted my a young gentlemen who was very helpful and respectful. He calmed me down and reassured me that everything was going to be okay ,as I was very very stressed thinking I was going to miss my flight. He then offered to give me fast track through security so I could get to my gate quicker. I just want to thank him again as he made my experience with British Airways like no other and I’m very grateful."
291,"✅ Trip Verified |  San Diego to Frankfurt via London. It all started when trying to check in online 24h before departure from San Diego to Heathrow. On long flights like this I always reserve an aisle seat. Online Check-in did not work, no reason was given. Ok, let’s call US hotline. I tried at least 40 times. Answers were either, that call could not be completed, check number or due to heavy call volume they could not process call right now. I did not make it through. As an act of desperation I today called a British number. The lady told me guess what: no more aisle seats available. Some other numbers I tried were available on weekdays only, good to know if you need help on a Sunday. So I‘ve got the strong feeling, that they do not even care about there customers. B On my flight to San Diego 5 days ago, my TV screen was gone and there was no way to change seats. Great overall experience."
292,✅ Trip Verified | Flown with British Airways on numerous occasions with no issues. However on this occasion my baggage was lost on arrival at Gatwick. There was no British airways representative at the baggage claim however there was a phone that allowed me to call the baggage department. Reclaiming lost baggage was simple and my bag was put on the next flight to Singapore which I received the following day.
293,"✅ Trip Verified | Flying last Sunday from Geneva to Piladelphia via London in business class. When I arrived at the boarding gate in London to take my flight to Philadelphia they told me that there was no sufficient business seat available! They overbooked! My choice was then either to fly ecenomy or to take the next flight! They just did not care about their customer. No phone call, no email, no indication at the lounge nothing until I was at the boarding gate. I kindly accepted to take the next flight. The plane was delayed by 1 hour due to technical issues. When I arrived at Philadelphia, no suitcase! No British Airways desk on arrival, it was late no one could help. I finally retrieve my suitcase 3 days later: broken! During these 3 days, it was impossible to get someone on the phone. On my flight back to Geneva, same issue! no sufficient business class seats available. It is clear that this company just don't care about their customers, they just care about their money !"
294,✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Paris CDG. Quick and easy flight to Paris. Took just 40 minutes to reach CDG. Everything went well and the cabin was very clean. The only complaint was boarding which too way too long and was very unorganized.
295,"✅ Trip Verified |  Johannesburg to London. At Johannesburg used BA galleries lounge which was fine if a little busy. Plane boarded on time, very hot due to lack of auxiliary power unit, given aircraft at JNB all day, perhaps this could have been addressed. After take off the crew dispensed with pre dinner drinks and went straight for meal. Portions of starter very small, I was given someone else’s by mistake which was then taken away and given to him. I thought that originally the idea of the new Club World meal involved a trolley service but no sign of that. Main was good (beef), dessert was cheese, very small basic selection. Then bed, gap in seat made lie flat less comfortable. Breakfast was ok. Delay with baggage due to another aircraft technical issue (there seemed to be a few of these). Arrivals lounge was good. Overall an average experience."
296,"✅ Trip Verified | Edinburgh to Bangalore via Heathrow. Rude staff, poor service, missing baggage, poor entertainment system. I spilled my drink and the attitude of the staff was brutal. I apologised for my clumsiness, but I was made to feel like I had deliberately done some shameful act in public and staff would not want to have anything to do with me. I asked for tissues and the answer was, get it from the toilet. The staff did not even have the courtesy to ask me if I needed another drink once I cleaned myself up. The crew were also extremely noisy. Chatting and laughing loudly at the pantry place for the entire duration. And then - while boarding at Edinburgh, they offered to check in my second bag for free because cabin was full. The staff wrote Bangalore via Heathrow, but my bag was not loaded to connecting flight. 4 hours gap mind you. "
297,"✅ Trip Verified |  
Berlin to Johannesburg via London. The short haul flight between Berlin and London was oKay, they don't include drinks or snacks anymore on short distance flights and prices onboard for them are compared to some low-cost carriers high. Because of an engine problem, the flights from LHR to JNB was delayed by 2:45h. British Airways gave £5 vouchers out to compensate for snacks and drinks. Inside the A380, the IFE boxes under the window seats take a big part of the available leg space."
298,✅ Trip Verified | New York JFK to London Heathrow with British Airways. An extremely average flight. Nothing stood out as good and nothing stood out as bad. The flight was smooth and felt quite short. The cabin crew was helpful and everything was comfortable. The inflight entertainment needed some work.
299,"Not Verified |  I've always favoured British Airways and will always try and choose to fly with them, which is mostly decided by flight times for my business travel. I have always found it better value over the cheaper airlines via their additonal benefits like early check-in and on-flight catering, for economy. However BA have stripped both the above perks. I now struggle to see the value, and put their offering almost beside that of the likes of Easyjet, yet you pay almost double. Then today I flew back from Denmark with SAS, and it was amazing and made BA look cheap. Not only do you get a good meal on board, you get free drink, can charge your electronics and get wifi (for only 2.9 Euros!). Outstanding."
300,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew British Airways from Madrid to London Heathrow. An aircraft full of people. We were being asked to check-in our hand luggage or, in some cases, to leave it by the aircraft and pick it up upon arrival. I must say I find this irritating, as I had one piece of luggage, within the rules. Other people didn't. Those should be asked to do this. I truly felt as if I were in a low cost airline, which is sad to see. Short-haul with BA never again!"
301,"✅ Trip Verified |  Tel Aviv to London. We arrived at the airport with a lot of time due to the stories of how long security can take. The stories were true, although it is actually a very efficient and well organised airport, they just have very thorough border and immigration services as well as all passengers face enhanced security scanning of hand luggage etc. There were limited priority options available for First Class passengers, although I suspect that is more down to the airport than British Airways. The lounge provided is a third party one and is the same for business and first, and isn’t really acceptable. If it was just business then it would be ‘fine I guess’ but there is not very much seating, the food offerings were almost non existent and drinks were limited. Even the main coffee machine was broken so there was another, very complicated, machine with all instructions only in Hebrew. At the gate there was the usual ‘priority boarding’ queue as well as the regular queue. But the priority queue included all first and club passengers as well as all Oneworld emerald, sapphire and ruby members - which is a lot of people! Whilst it is nice to offer a perk to all of those members, there really should be another queue for first and Oneworld emerald as the queue was quite long. The service on board didn’t start off very well for me as due to some confusion amongst the crew I got missed out when crew were offering drinks amenity kits etc, and after seeing every one was finished and the crew were all relaxing at the front I had to go to the galley and ask. They were very apologetic and provided excellent service for the rest of the flight but those kind of mistakes really shouldn’t happen in first. The seat is comfortable and offers a reasonable level of privacy and storage space. Annoyingly the ife has to be stowed for take off and landing, which limits how much you can watch. It was the Thales entertainment system so the quality was reasonable and with a fairly good selection of things to watch. The food and drinks on board were all excellent, including a delicious veal cheek main course and some wonderful wines that went together very well. Aside from the hiccup at the beginning, the whole experience on board felt very attentive and special. It would have been nice to have been referred to by name, which I have had before on BA and with other airlines, even in business class. On arrival the priority bags came out incredibly quickly and were on the belt before we got there, which was impressive as immigration had also been very quick. Overall this was a very nice flight with a solid product and excellent crew, let down only by the ground service in Israel. I used Avios and a companion voucher for this flight so it worked out excellent value for money."
302,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Tel Aviv. Arrived at Heathrow at about 5pm expecting it to be very busy, but check and security felt like it was 10pm, very easy and quick process (which included regular rather than fast track security as we didn’t follow the signs properly). We used galleries south lounge and first impressions were actually pretty poor, although they did later improve. The food offering on arrival was a few sandwiches, soup and some dry cake. This wasn’t really acceptable at all although about an hour after we arrived the evening meals were laid out and there was a good selection of hot and cold dishes which were quite tasty. Drinks overall were good as always with British Airways although champagne is only served on request and the quality of the one provided was really quite appalling. In terms of seating, there was enough for all the passengers in there, and it was quite busy, and due to it being broken up into different areas it felt like a nice place, although better variety in seating, including some more comfortable chairs, would be appreciated as well as a bit of modernising. This biggest failing was the staff in the lounge, which were more similar to staff in a factory canteen than what you find in competitors lounges. Smiles are free and go a long way, and whilst being unobtrusive can be a good quality, eerily walking around slightly like a zombie, seruptitiously clearing your table without any interaction whatsoever was just plain odd! The other area which I find completely below standard are the toilets. Whilst they are kept clean and there are some nice touches with flowers etc, the general standard of the toilet decor was more like a cheap gym locker room. The regular Heathrow airport toilets are far far nicer and to a higher quality. Whilst the individual toilet cubicles with self contained wash areas are nice, there aren’t really enough and some regular wash room facilities and urinals as well would make it easier. On board me and my friend had the centre two seats at the very back of the cabin. This meant that we basically had our own private suite as well as direct aisle access. These seats are fantastic when travelling with someone and as good as any business offering from any airline in terms of comfort, privacy and access. Unfortunately this was an ancient 777 with the old ife, which is a completely unacceptable product in terms of resolution, selection and even the fact that some screens won’t even stay in place and fold themselves away! British Airways need to have an active plan to refurbish or replace all of these aircraft, end of story! Even the Thales system is showing its age now, but this Rockwell Collins one makes vhs tapes look state of the art! The cabin crew were slightly mixed in terms of level of service and experience. Some were clearly not in sync with each other when serving drinks and meals etc, and some were rather abrupt and unfriendly. Others however were absolutely wonderful and made the whole flight a wonderful experience. Food and drinks on board were actually quite good, although the on board service was not the new club world one on this route yet. Overall it was a very enjoyable flight, and as I booked using Avios and a companion voucher it was exceptional value for money. Having said that, I would have still considered it good value even if paying cash."
303,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kuala Lumpur to Madrid via London. My first time flying BA and I had very low expectations. Fortunately, my experience was pleasant as the seats were generally comfortable and overall service was good. The service (KUL-LHR) was brusque. Meal was served not long after take off and my child was already sleeping as it was past midnight. I had asked if we could have it later but the reply was a curt NO and that they couldn't give it to us later nor would they have any snacks to offer. So if we got hungry we would just have to wait more than 8 hours later for the next meal. Luckily on the return route we had a very courteous cabin crew who spoke politely. Both aircrafts appeared new and the seats were wide enough for us. Some people complained about the entertainment unit under the seats. What I didn't like though is that the arm rest couldn't be kept up totally between the 2 seats so that my child could lie across his seat and mine. The armrest kind of went up to a max of 80 degree angle. The seat pockets were very small so there's very little that can kept inside. The toilets were generally clean but the toilet seat lids didn't work properly. They always fall back down and there was never seat liners. Food was below average."
304,❎ Not Verified |  Madrid to London Heathrow on a busy Monday evening in November was an entirely mixed affair. Boarding was from the satellite terminal which was efficient and well managed. Boarding was rather slow as too many people were allowed to bring aboard large amounts of luggage. This resulted in some bags being removed and placed into the hold. Some passengers were poorly behaved and argued with the staff. Every single seat was occupied. This was quite hard on the staff. A trendy safety instruction took place with a video of certain UK based TV personalities. This was in English only. The inflight service was very poor. I ordered a sandwich and a drink and had my receipt chucked at me. Disembarkation was slow again due to the large amount of luggage. I regard this as a health and safety matter. British Airways is not what it was and on this route there are alternatives offering better service.
305,❎ Not Verified |  Flew British Airways from Bologna to London Heathrow. We arrived at Bologna Airport to be told at the bag check in that the plane had been overbooked and that we would have to wait until boarding closed before we would know if there was a seat for us. We were both amazed and surprised since we had booked this return flight several weeks earlier and had arrived at the airport in good time. The member of staff dealing with us was particularly brusque and unhelpful and the only information that we were given was a typed sheet setting out the fact that if we did not travel we would be able to claim compensation. For us this was not acceptable since we had to be in the Lake District the following day. We were eventually allowed onto the plane but would not have made it if it had not been for a fellow passenger who seemed to know how to get around the queues in this situation. I thought that these problems were only found on the well known cut price airlines!
306,"❎ Not Verified |  My husband and I booked our honeymoon to Italy through American Airlines which unknowingly routed us to their partner airlines, British Airways. We ran immediately into trouble when we received an email notice that our flights have been changed and we now had a 40 minute layover at London Heathrow and we would not arrive in Rome in the AM as planned. We decided to give it a shot regardless. We arrived at BWI and discovered we were not on an AA flight and had packed more bags than BA would allow. (We had three checked bags instead of 2 and British Airways only allows one checked bag or you pay close to $100 for additional). Luckily the gentlemen at the counter checked the bag at no charge. I can't say the same for the rest of our trip. We found that the flight was full and they had not placed our seats together for a 6.5 hr flight and we had 2 middle seats. The neighbors on our flight refused to swap seats, originally then after some pity complaining a lovely woman swapped. We arrived into London around 9am. late of course, and after running to the next terminal in an attempt to make our connection, we missed our flight and were unable to make it through security. The BA representative told us the next flight was full and we would have to wait until 5pm. We again explained that we were on our honeymoon and had afternoon ticket reservations in Rome. The BA representative was then able to find two seats on a 12pm flight - so we missed our ticket reservations but were able to get into Rome for dinner. Upon our return flights, we attempted three times to reserve seats online via British Airways app and web (learning from before) and the website kept giving us an error screen even though the charge was pending on my PayPal account. We eventually had to make an international call and pay $174 to ensure we were able to sit next to each other on the 8 hr flight home, though we could not select seats for our connecting flight to London. Once we arrived at Rome to check - we got hit with the $100 additional baggage fee (we we tried to explain, the representative refused to comp the bag). Upon arriving at the gate my ticket was pinged for having an extra bag that was not paid for. Luckily, we had the receipt from paying 2 hrs earlier. Otherwise I imagine we would've had to shell out $100 again. We are crossing our fingers for a safe trip home, as we are again delayed on our flight from Rome to London. If you fly British Airways prepare to be nickled and dimed at every part of your journey. "
307,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew British Airways from London Heathrow to Johannesburg. Plane at T5 Satellite C, so used B Galleries Lounge, which was quiet and pleasant. Efficient boarding, seats 50J/K on upper deck, which provided good privacy despite proximity to toilets. Mixed crew FAs and ours were young and enthusiastic. In-flight service good, with a notable improvement in the quality of food, i.e., courses delivered individually to seats and main courses not cooked to a crisp. IFE lagging behind that offered by competitors, with small screens and limited movies. Breakfast included four hot options which were more palatable than usual. Overall, a good flight, although we look forward to promised improvements in 2018."
308,"✅ Verified Review | London Heathrow to Brussels. I had to travel for a surgery that had to be done in Belgium. Going there the staff at check-in in were amazing, as I had missed my plane she did everything possible for me to be on the next flight at a good price. However coming back to London the staff were quite rude and not acknowledging. I got on the plane and asked if I could have help to place my hand luggage into the locker as I could not carry anything nor lift my hand due to my operation. The first staff member at the entrance told me that I had to ask a member of staff closer to my seat, if no one could help then he will try to come. So that’s what I did, but the member of staff refused as she told me that she wasn’t allowed to carry a bag unless I help her and even after explaining the situation, she just ignored it and just left me alone with my suitcase. Luckily another passenger heard me and carried my bag to the top and helped my get it down at the end. I work in retail and I know about customer service but very disappointed with my expirience coming back especially on the plane. I am very angry by this situation and next time I will think twice before choosing the company again."

Flew London to San Francisco. British Airways provided a functional, disinterested service on this ten hour flight. We were given what was necessary and certainly no more. Ignored for five hours, not even a glass of water offered and it was made clear that the staff were happy to do the bare minimum and no more. If you have to go with British Airways, do, but if you can avoid them then I would. In the interest of fairness I have informed the customer service team at British Airways of my experience - so far I have been ignored hence writing this review."
310,"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Seoul Incheon. I was flying my return leg back to Korea after a Christmas vacation. I had not had a pleasant experience on my initial leg and unfortunately had no better experience on the return. To start with, i was unable to pre order my meal on line due to a technical fault. Having not had my selection available on the outbound leg (in business class!) i wanted to ensure i had something for my return. I couldn't pre book and of course when offered the meal by the cabin crew they had AGAIN run out of 50% of the available selections. Quite disgraceful. I was also unable to check in on line, so i was ""directed"" by staff to use the kiosk at the airport which also did not work. Eventually i made it passed the staff and was allowed to queue for the business class check in. The rest of the airport process after that was smooth. This time i sat at the rear of the business class cabin in the window seat. This meant that I did not have to step over somebody else feet and legs if I wanted to get out of my chair in flight. Of course I had to pay extra $'s for the seat selection in business class - a point which i have made before about being very unhappy about in a premium cabin. The flight was uneventful. On this occasion I had a very warm crew for which I appreciated. Overall I still feel that BA is just too cheap on it's product and this is not an acceptable practice especially in a premium class. Frankly, even though they were the cheaper ticket price by the time I had paid extra for the seat and not had my meal choices available i would have been better off flying another carrier."
311,"✅ Verified Review |  Seoul Incheon to London Heathrow. This was my first flight on BA for many years. As a Brit, I was actually looking forward to flying them in order to return home for Christmas on board the relatively new B787. I was disappointed. The fare I paid on this occasion was relatively good value for a J class cabin - in my view. However, it was extremely disappointing to see that you have to pay to select your seat in J class. I do not know of and have not ever flown another airline which charges you for this and I certainly do not appreciate it. I was seated in row 1 by the window. My first experience in this cabin was a shock when I realised I was looking straight into the face of the passenger sitting next to me. And further that i had to step over the legs of the passenger in row 2 to get into and out from my seat. The tray table did not sit straight when pulled out for service. Even in row 1, by the time the cabin crew came to take my meal order they were already telling me that two of the available options had already run out. This left me taking a Korean option on a flight on BA where the majority of the passengers seemed to be non-Korean. Clearly something wrong with the meal ratios. They offer a serve yourself snack bar in flight. I went to the galley at one point and there was very little available to take food wise - it was mostly just drinks. It also seemed to be a fixed meal time - something else i do not appreciate in business class these days when dine on demand is a far better option for passengers. The IFE selection was nothing more than average. I found the overall selection somewhat limited compared to other carriers. The service and product simply left me feeling that BA is way behind other carriers and I concluded that i would not make a point of flying with them again on a long haul route in a premium cabin."
312,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Cape Town to London with British Airways. It’s hard to think of a good thing about this flight. On the outward journey I was in an aisle seat. Next to me was somebody who was too large to comfortably be able to occupy a middle seat. The crew could have helped the poor person out by offering an aisle but they made no attempt. So three people suffered cramped conditions for 11 hours. The food is awful, poor quality and with poor selection of wines - cheap Spanish wine with no choice, the cabin was over heated. It was the most uncomfortable flight I have ever taken. Until my return flight - entertainment system was not working - ancient plane same miserable food. This airline used to be good, now it is awful."
313,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Bahrain club world and they certainly like to pack folk into a business class cabin in a 2-4-2 configuration which is out of date and hardly worthy of business class cabin compared to the likes of Qatar, Emirates, Etihad which are far more superior. The plane was old along with a tired cabin and dirty unkempt bathroom basins that had permanent staining which need replacing. On this flight good choice of foods with attentive staff. Cost cutting was in evidence in the amenity bag you get, the presentation of food trays and the personnel service had gone. It's more akin to economy, also a real negative point is your at Heathrows newest terminal & guess what you are transported to your aircraft by buses! A shining example of what is supposed to be a modern airport. This flight is definitely not 5 star and a 3 star rating is where this airline should sit. Plane was delayed 45 mins & arrived 25 mins late so not exactly a good timekeeping record either. IFE was poor with old films that they call new releases, no where near on a par with Qatar Airways."
314,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Philadelphia. Ticket booked was an AMEX companion ticket so effectively family of 4 travelled for £2.5k in business class return so very good value. Positives - B747 on both journeys was refurbished so very clean and great IFE. Cabin quiet and crew amazingly helpful. T5 Lounge fine, flight on time. Bags off very quickly. Negatives - food on on both legs wasn't great. Salad poor and main beef meal very average. Pudding which is normally the show stopper - not great. In previous years food been excellent. Return journey just the same - except for the crew this time being outstandingly helpful. We were travelling with a baby and a toddler and the crew couldn't do enough to help. The real test of the crew was on landing at LHR, we were walking up the jetty and my 3 year old daughter was sick all over me. We were stood on the jetty trying to sort the situation and all the crew after a long flight came to help us. They were amazing. They didn't have to as they were done for the day. BA are getting so much stick at the moment - their hard product is fine if you are redeeming a companion ticket but not if you are paying in excess of £15k. The crew lift this product to a much higher level."
315,"✅ Verified Review |  British Airways short haul Business Class is nothing more than an economy class seat and maximum 31 inch pitch, with lounge access and a meal thrown in. So is it worth paying three times the cost of an economy ticket? BA recently introduced Business Class on domestic routes and as I got a decent price for booking well in advance, decided to try it out. Checking in was efficient, and the Galleries Club Lounge adequate (no comparison whatsoever with Asian or Middle Eastern Airline lounges). Priority boarding although announced, did not make any difference as economy and business class passengers were in the same queue and confused. Having maneuvered into the cramped seat, I was offered a hot towel as soon as I sat down. I couldn't decide whether to be amused or embarrassed by the new celebrity cast safety video. It was more spot the stars, than listen to the safety instructions. But I guess it was something different BA was trying out. The service on board was surprisingly efficient and swift. Soon after take off, a tasty snack and bar service with premium brands was offered on this one hour flight. The service was good, considering a one hour flight. Despite a Boeing 767, 2x2x2 layout, the cabin felt claustrophobic. To me, this was no different than economy seating, with virtually no leg room. How can this be branded as Business Class? Is the extra cost justified to fly Club Europe? Absolutely not."
316,"✅ Verified Review |  I requested Asian vegetarian food both ways including my return flight from Oakland to Gatwick on the 6th November, but I was very disappointed that my requirement was not fulfilled.  I was told that on my connection flight I have to pick up my luggage and then check it again at Phoenix airport for connection flight which I never heard before as normally all the airlines do the checking luggage transfer themselves and passengers just have to do security checks and board the flight. When I reached Phoenix first security took long time to clear then luggage took time to come then I had to go on the different level to check in, then down to go through security again to board my flight. On my return flight from Oakland to Gatwick when I went to the check in luggage I was told by the staff at the desk that TSA will break my lock to check through my luggage, so please keep it unlocked.  I requested Asian vegetarian food but when I got my special meal it was cholesterol fat free diet. When I mentioned this to the staff who gave me this food she said that’s what you asked for but I said sorry I didn’t as on the food label clearly says 18A and my seat no is 18K so how is this my food. She still didn’t believe me instead of apology she said I have to get back on this matter to provide you food as we might not have spare food to offer you. After 15 mins of wait once she serving all the passengers she came to me and told me that if you want I can offer you full English breakfast I said but I am vegetarian she said I don’t have any other option. "
317,"✅ Verified Review |  Am continually disappointed by British Airways. It seems they are now in a race with Ryanair and easyJet to become the worst carrier in and out of the UK. Flew Düsseldorf to London. Their lounge at DUS is closed but their check-in staff doesn't know that (she sent me up there). I have a connexion at JFK and I showed her the boarding passes but she wouldn't interline my bag to their partner AA and I had to recheck it. Now, not only do they not serve a second meal on the 11-hour flight LHR-LAX, but now they want £2 for a can of coca cola that they pay 15p for. Usually, you should always fly across the ocean on a European carrier, but with BOAC I recommend Finnair or American with their One World alliance. What is the point?"
318,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Santiago. Cabin crew generally helpful and friendly. Cabin a bit grubby; crumbs, nuts and grime in evidence. On the flight home as I took my seat I saw a bit of the wrapper of the ear plugs they give out which seemed to have been left over from the previous flight - evidence that whoever wields the vacuum cleaner before the passengers board needs to be a bit more thorough. The alcoholic drinks were all pleasant. The food was of variable quality (as was the coffee) none bad, some a bit mediocre, some good. Many have commented on the somewhat odd seat arrangement and I found it a bit of a palaver to have to carefully step over another, sleeping, passenger's legs trying not to wake them up. The other problem with that configuration is the video screen has to be stowed at take off and landing which means you can't watch it, as you can in economy when the screen is on the back of the seat in front of you. On both flights I found that my screen seemed to be broken and would not lock in position so that I would have to look at it at an angle. I solved the problem by stuffing a rolled up magazine in the hinge bit, but then I had to take it out every time I got out of my seat. Another problem with the configuration is that the storage space is minimal; apart from the overhead lockers there is only a small drawer. And that adds to the litter problem. After you have taken off the polythene wrappers for your headphones and blanket or the paper ring around your napkin, what do you do with it? Er, drop it on the floor? I did manage to sleep quite well, though the pillow you are provided with is very thin. On the flight back they gave me another one when I asked. Another small problem is that there is no individual air conditioning vent for your seat and if you take off your jacket, sweater or whatever, the lack of storage space means it has to go in the overhead locker if you have already filled up the little drawer. And I don't want to seem a bit picky, but although the in-flight entertainment has a good choice of films, the menu system for seeing what they are is a bit irritating; they are all divided into categories such as ""comedy"", ""thrillers"" etc but no A-Z. All in all, it wasn't an unpleasant experience but I would advise BA, if they were interested in my advice, that they need to clean the planes more often and more thoroughly and re-think the seat configuration."
319,"✅ Verified Review |  London to New York JFK in club world. After reading very mixed reviews here, I also saw that BA were upgrading standards on flights to NYC in particular and was looking forward to my flight. Should not have been so optimistic, as this is still a business class that belongs in the 1980's. Aircraft was tatty to be polite about it, worn carpets, seat with various malfunctioning or broken items, washrooms grimy from the word go. Staff tried hard to offer a modicum of good service, but the so called food improvements were really not much better than other premium economy cabins I have flown when I have to pay for the ticket. BA talk a lot about their premium standards, but even when you pay to-dollar for business class the standards are well below even their US counterparts. Complete rip-off sums it up."
320,"✅ Verified Review |  My wife and I booked two round trip business class air tickets from Johannesburg to Victoria Falls with British Airways / Comair. It turned out that our business class seats were not any different from the seats in the economy class: they had exactly the same width and pitch! Actually, British Airways simply separated several seats in the front from the rest of the aircraft cabin with a curtain, and called this a business class! Moreover, our pre-flight accommodations were not any better than those of the economy class passengers because British Airways does not even have a lodge for business class passengers in Victoria Falls. Yes, during the flight we were served sparkling wine and snacks, but does this difference substantiate my paying for two round trip tickets $1,372 rather than $703, which would have been the cost of the economy class tickets?"
321,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Mumbai. The electrics at my seat were not working. This may have been related but the remote control that was completely broken with loose  wires etc. - The call button light kept coming on and off on its own. It was impossible for me to control this and at the time that I did actually want to contact the flight attendant, I had to use my husband's remote control to do so. - Because the connection was loose on my remote, it meant that things were changing on my TV screen without me being able to control it e.g. I would press play on the screen, then the program would pause or start rewinding without me doing anything. Because my remote controller was broken, it would not return properly into the socket and kept 'pinging' back out. This was  annoying when you are trying to relax in your seat. The TV screen was  faulty. The usual 'push and release' button did not work, I had to push the button and then just try to 'pull' the screen, it was very tough. Even the cabin crew could not release it properly. My footrest was very stiff and hard to manoeuvre on my own - my husband had to help every time I wanted to move this. My husbands footrest was  broken - The charging socket at my seat did not work, so I could not charge my phone or laptop for the entire flight. My husbands charging socket also did not work. the flight attendant told me that this was an issue on some of the other seats in our row. This is not related to my seat however the storage unit above my seat/row kept opening throughout the flight. The attendant would shut it and then it would  open, this happened during take off and landing, as well as throughout the flight.  For this level of airline and Club World seat, it is not acceptable that you should have to rely on your personal equipment.  This return flight was the first time that I have flown business class. We have spent tens of thousands of pounds on our American Express card to earn the points required and to generate the companion voucher, for us to be able to fly business class for our honeymoon. Whilst the outbound flight was great, I was very disappointed with the return flight and shocked by the poor quality of the seat. The hostess tried to reset my screen which made no difference and in fact, the situation got worse. Once I had tried to turn on the screen and once it the hostess had attempted a re-set; after that, the screen just kept flicking on and off for the remaining 3.5 hrs of the flight. As you can imagine, it is very annoying to have a screen flick on and off with no way of controlling it. It was impossible to turn the screen off completely."
322,"✅ Verified Review |  I travelled to Johannesburg from London Heathrow on Sunday 22nd October on flight BA55 and my husband was meant to travel with my two daughters on the same flight on 23rd October. They were refused boarding on the grounds that children cannot travel with a single parent to South Africa. There was no such requirement on booking the tickets via BA's website and there was no notification of this by the airline at any stage. The requirement is not even on the front page of the embassy's website but well hidden under drop down menus. Usually when there are requirements like for ESTA for entry into US, BA sends a prompt. However, there was nothing in this case. BA had on its system that I (the other parent) had travelled BA already reach Johannesburg a day before. The BA counter staff at the airport refused to help my husband, who was travelling with a 4 and 7 year old with any alternative. Instead they directed to use the website to cancel tickets. After being given the wrong email address first, when finally managed to get in touch with customer relations, they refused to refund the ticket cost, only refunded taxes 25% of total. The overall service and the way it was dealt was extremely stressful at the airport and off-putting. They said they would use the complain to improve their processes but will not refund in excess of GBP 2k in tickets as they were cancelled prior to the flights upon refused boarding even the return flights and not within 24hrs of booking. Other airlines offer alternatives but here the attitude was extremely dismissive, even though both my husband and I are frequent travellers and have Silver cards of their Executive program. I will avoid travelling BA even for work after this event. Have received better treatment from low cost airlines in the past."
323,"✅ Verified Review |  Heathrow to Lyon. The worst customer service I have ever experienced! I arrived at the airport a good 2 hours before the flight only to be told that the flight is overbooked and that I could not check in. After a long wait to ascertain if anyone will not be turning up, I was told I can go on a different flight - the problem being that the only available flight was the one going out the following morning. So I missed a whole day's business meeting and was forced to do the round trip home and back to the airport in a matter of one day. When I queried the fact that I was unable to board I was told that overselling the flight was normal - ""all airlines do it"". The fact that all of them do it of course is not a justification nor explanation. I was casually advised to read the small print in the future. On the way back from my destination, in order to avoid the same thing happening, I decided to check in online 24 hours before. However, I was again denied a check in and was put on a stand by. Apparently, the return flight is overbooked again! I do not understand how it is possible that the product/service that I have purchased, I can not use. How can it be legal that the company has no responsibility to honour their contractual obligation to provide me the service that I have duly purchased a good 4 months in advance!!!! The disregard for its customers and the sheer arrogance of this huge, inept company is beyond pale! On top of that, the company's decision to no longer serve coffee/tea and food on board is unacceptable. The BA has made a foolish decision to behave like a budget airline but still keep charging premium prices. I certainly will never travel the BA ever again!"
324,"✅ Verified Review |  Absolutely appalling service from BA! I booked seats with extra leg room with a BA representative to ensure I was getting the seats we needed. On arrival at the aircraft we did not have those seats, our return flight was the same. So I applied for a refund, after a lot of back and forth with BA they started paying it back, in drips and drabs, not the full amount - so far I have received half of the amount owed! I traveled 6 months ago - I have called a dozen times, emailed and filled out forms and the last I heard was that someone would contact me and would sort this matter out - no one has called back in 2 months now. When I call they say “you can’t chase anymore, You have to await for someone to call you” BA you are a disgrace, I have been patient and you have done nothing! Worst airline I have ever had to deal with!"

326,"✅ Verified Review |  Heathrow to Barcelona. Reliable. No longer feels like travelling with a premium airline. Very functional, but unfortunately at a cost. Flight took off late, because luggage for a passenger needed to be off loaded, however arrived on time in Barcelona. Excellent information from the flight deck. Cabin crew robotic and lacked personality. Enough has already been said about charges for food and drink. Overall falling well below the standards of the competition. Great pity really."
327,"✅ Verified Review |  Singapore to London. My feedback seems to mirror many other users here - BA standards are just getting worse and worse, and I am talking about business class which I thought they would maintain? The cabin interior was worn and quite grubby, the seats terrible and now must be one of the poorest for long haul business class. The meal and presentation is really a joke, and on my previous long haul biz trip I got better food in Lufthansa premium economy. Cabin staff were quite friendly although they do hide in the galley a lot. Chatted to one of them who said so many customers are complaining and even deserting BA because of the fall in standards - I'm not surprised and I for one would not use them again for long haul. Time for senior management changes, as the present CEO clearly has no clue how to run what was once a premium airline. Now, they do little more than a low-cost and easyjet for one is far superior and nicer for short hops in Europe."
328,"✅ Verified Review | British Airways appear to be taking positive steps to lift their game. The service on this flight was flight was materially better than that previously experienced. The quality of the food served had lifted materially. The staff were helpful. The big downside is that Club Europe sets remains stock standard economy seats - with the middle seat blocked off. The pitch is tight - too tight in my view. Another couple of centimetres would be welcome. Overall, a better BA experience."
329,"✅ Verified Review |  Heathrow to Dubai. This is a warning of what to expect from British Airways . If they continue to treat passengers this way I can see the airline very quickly getting into difficulty. The reply I got from the airline below just brushed all the issues I raised under the carpet. Living in Egypt for 10 years I became I frequent flyer with Egyptair. If I wanted to change the date of travel with them they only charged me £60. BA want to charge me over £500 and because I wanted to cancel my flight and go with a better airline they were only prepared to give me a £9.50 refund even though I would have given them over 2 months notice. This airline is on my black list, makes me ashamed to think this is my national airline, but never again will I book another flight with BA. There was no priority seat booking unless I paid another £38 extra. There was no priority boarding. I booked seat 23D but this was mysteriously changed at check in to 24E. BA emailed me to confirm a change in the booking but did not say what that change was. I did not make any changes. In premium economy I was wedged in like a sardine in a seat that is only 1"" wider than economy with a few inches extra leg room. Is this some kind of joke? I had to double check that I wasn't in economy as there is only one seat difference in a row. The tough chicken meal was diabolical. The cabin light over the bulkhead luggage bins was jammed on and would not go out so no sleep whatsoever. I really do not see the necessity for this light anyhow as the non smoking lights and tv screen light give emit sufficient light anyway. I ended up paying £300 extra for nothing and am extremely disappointed with this flight. A few days previously I flew premium Economy with Virgin Atlantic return from Barbados and the difference between BA and Virgin is worlds apart."
330,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew British Airways from Tokyo Haneda to London Heathrow. This is one of the worst flights I have ever had. The seats were so weak that I felt every movement of the passangers around me, especially the guy in front. Really old entertainment system and my friend next to me was missing the audio outlet! Food was also horrible."
331,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Toronto. By now it is nothing new anymore that the CEOs very aggressive cost cutting, affected all classes including First & Business which called “Club World” does not deserve it name, because it is simply appalling! Again it is on the cost of the customer and eventually on the aircrews who have to work harder, because there are smaller teams.  It is not surprising that BA current ranking bounced back to 40th from 26th (in 2016). Fact is that this airlines which prefers rather to invest its money in flashy nonsense commercial rather than in its products does clearly not deserve to be recommended. Once a grand airline, today just another 2 star airline like there are so many."
332,"✅ Verified Review |  New York to London Heathrow.  First class check in at T7 in JFK was quick, polite staff provide better service than those at Heathrow. The Concorde Room is just a few metres after security.  It is nice enough with a good range of seating and dining booths, but washroom / shower facilities are downmarket. Selected a couple of a la carte menu choices and these were nicely presented and tasty. Boarding was reasonably efficient,  and staff onboard offered usual boarding drinks, pyjamas etc. Delay of about 30 mins on departure was made up during the flight. I opted to sleep straight after take off,  seat comfort is okay if a little narrow.  90 minutes before arrival I had some fruits and pastry for breakfast,  accompanied by some good coffee. While I only needed minimal service onboard,  the staff were courteous and efficient,  and they are one of very few good things left after BA after their CEO seems to have decided to alienate loyal customers of 40 years!  Arrival into T5 at Heathrow,  B satellite at 0515 was absolute bedlam, and a reason I would choose another airline on this route. We wanted for 4 satellite trains to pass by totally full before we could even get to the main Terminal -  to find Immigration in total,  disorganised chaos. I buy and pay for my own tickets,  and do feel that BA is now grossly overpriced forge standards they provide. Please get a CEO that values quality over bean-counting."
333,"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Marrakech, the cabin crew was lazy and rude, refusing to sell a pack of sweets which would have not taken more than 30 seconds . For the duration of half of the flight they sat in the back having a break during which all service stopped. Half way through the flight we ordered some sweets from the food menu. The lady that passed said that they will come back once they had finished serving some other customers. After 30 minutes we pressed the bell for assistance and one of the staff came to rudely explain that they hadn’t finished serving other customers even though none of the 3 staff members was seen serving anyone. We waited 20 minutes before pressing the bell again which was ignored. After another 10 Minutes my partner went to the back of the cabin to order the pack of sweets but the cabin crew explained that they are having a break now and that they stopped serving. We tried for over 1 hour to buy some Jaffa cakes which would have taken less than 30 seconds but it was too much to ask for. Ryanair or EasyJet Service is luxury compared to the service of this cabin crew. I will not use BA again if I can avoid it and cannot recommend this airline ."
334,"✅ Verified Review |  This was my first time flying with British Airways from Los Angeles to London Heathrow. I was able to secure a window seat for myself (without paying any fee) during online check-in 24 hours prior to departure. The baggage drop-off experience at LAX and LHR was smooth. At LAX, the BA staff tags your check-in bags, at LHR, you have to do it yourself. The on-board experience was good. This was my first time sitting on the upper-deck of A380 (which had a special storage bin by the window armrest). Food options were consistent with what you find on most transatlantic flights (Chicken or Pasta). There was no WiFi, but BA had a good collection of movies. I enjoyed BA's in-flight ""movie snack"" as well. The ""Flight Map / Tracker"" wasn't working on one segment, which was a bit surprising. Overall, I had a pleasant experience and would consider flying with BA again."
335,✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Cagliari proved to be a rather pleasant and well organised affair. The website was easy to use and very clear. I checked-in online and simply had to drop off my bag. I arrived very early for the flight and noted that there was quite a queue already. The boarding process was quick and efficient and the interior of the aircraft was clean. My seat was comfortable for a short flight. The captain made clear and informative announcements and the two crew I could see worked very hard and were pleasant. The crew made use of Italian and were cheerful and professional. My gripe is the awful use of Marks and Spencer food. This has to be purchased and a good few items were not available. There were no route maps and no entertainment systems. The lavatory was clean. Disembarkation was managed well.
336,"✅ Verified Review |  Shanghai to Tampa via Heathrow/Gatwick. We received deplorable customer service recently from British Airways. I purchased business class tickets on 11/28/2016 for flights on September 30, 2017. I purchased two tickets for a total of $9,676.26 plus an additional $652 for seat assignments. The problems occurred on our return flights. We were booked October 17, 2017 on BA168 Shanghai to LHR  London with continuing service, October 18, 2017 from London Gatwick)to Tampa. We were disembarking a cruise ship at the port of Shanghai on October 17, 2017. We checked in online 24 hours before our flights scheduled departure at 11:00 A.M. On the evening of October 16, 2017 the captain announced that the ship would not dock at the port as scheduled at 7:00 A.M. In the morning on October 17, the Captain announced that the Chinese had shut down the port and were not allowing any ships to dock. After these announcements we frantically tried to contact British Airways because we expected that we would miss our 11:00 AM flight. We were unable to do so. We were informed that in order to exit China without a visa, we needed to have proof of our flights leaving the country. We were aware of this requirement. We had not applied for a visa because we were only transiting from the ship to the airplane. We knew that without a visa of valid flights out, we would be escorted to the local Chinese police station until we could arrange flights out of the country. For obvious reasons we did not want to experience that situation. We were able to contact a travel agent via e-mail (our phone was not operating as we were at sea in Chin ). Our agent was able to contact British Airways and explain our situation. There was another flight that departed on October 18, which was 13 hours 40 minutes after our original flight. That was Flt BA 160. We were told here are your choices: 1. Pay a change fee of $884 and be down graded to premium economy on both flights, BA 160 and BA 2167 , even though we would be able to make BA 2167 as it did not depart London (LGW) until 11:55 AM on October 18, 2017. 2. Pay an additional $6,388 per person for a total of $12,776 to keep our business class status on both flights. (We had already paid $10,328.26 for these tickets). 3. Disembark the ship and take our chances with Chinese immigration. Option 2 was outrageous, Option 3 frightening. We felt we had no choice but to choose Option 1. The travel agent advised us to explain what had happened when we arrived at the airport at check-in and request our business class seats if they were available. When we checked in at PVG we asked if there were business class seats available. “Yes, several” was the response. We explained what had happened and asked as a courtesy if we could have those vacant seats. “Yes, for a cost of $12,776 “. Of course we refused to pay that amount. We were then charged additional baggage fees because as we had expected to be flying business class, two suitcases were over the 50 lbs limit for economy. While on board during that flight BA160, I went into the business class cabin and saw that there were indeed vacant seats. When we arrived in London we again asked to be seated in our originally purchased seats. Were we on the same flight as originally scheduled, but I was informed that our business class seats had already been assigned to other flyers. Apparently British Airways sold our seats or an upgrade to other passengers at our expense."
337,"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Marrakech. Generally a well organised flight and fairly full in Y class. My gripe is about the current food service. This was a fairly long short-haul flight scheduled for 3h 45m in which a reasonable meal service would be welcome and desirable. After a lot of comments from others who have flown BA recently we bought food in the terminal before departure as the coho-ice on board is very limited, especially as much seems to be already 'sold out'. The biggest issue is about the time taken to do the food selling. It took almost all of the flight time for the crew to work through the plane to serve every row even though I observed that about 60% of passengers bought nothing. Of course this led to problems for those wishing to go to the toilets at the rear when food service starts at the front, any passengers from front to middle have no access to aft toilets after the trolley has passed. Passengers resorted to using the forward toilets passing through business class which I assume was not welcomed by those passengers. I overheard a crew member saying that they were not going to duty free sales as they were out of time. It is ridiculous that this paid and limited service takes so long. I remember the days when a British Midland crew could serve a full cooked breakfast with tea or coffee to all 100 or so pax on a LHR to Middlesbrough flight scheduled for 40 minutes or an Aer Lingus crew serving hot breakfast to all on a turbulent flight of 1 hr from Dublin to London. If BA want to differentiate themselves from low cost carriers then this is not the way to do it."
338,"✅ Verified Review |  Oakland to Heathrow and this flight was fine. The worst that could be said is that there is no magic, that other airlines manage to provide. Left and arrived on time. FA attentive and professional. Food reasonable and alcohol served in generous proportions. My only real complaint was the inflight entertainment was rather poor with lots of old films and TV programmes and a mediocre choice of music."
339,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Sofia. Cabin crew were kind. This is the only positive thing. British Airways are now becoming as bad as Ryanair! Onboard passengers have to pay ridiculous amount of money even for a small bottle of water. When I booked my flight from Heathrow to Sofia, I was told I get a free checked in bag for my baby girl. A day before my flight I decided to double check this and called their customer service line and the guy on the phone told me I need to pay for checked in bag if I want one. I told him that there should be one included for my baby daughter but he said this is not true. I asked him to double check this and he said he already did so I had to pay for a checked bag (£30 each way) since I already had my suitcase packed. Next day, as I went to the check in at Heathrow, I was asked how many bags do I want to check in. I asked how many bags am I allowed to check in and the lady said I can check in two bags- one for my baby and the one that I’ve paid for the previous day. The thing is that I only had one suitcase since the guy on the phone told me I can only check one bag (if I pay for it first). After I arrived in Sofia, I rang British airways and explained everything, so they agreed they should refund the money they’ve charged me for the additional bag. They said they’ll refund the £30 for the London-Sofia flight the same day and the other £30 fee for the Sofia-London route in about a week time. A month later I checked my online banking and saw they’ve only refunded £30 for the outbound journey. I rang them and they’ve said they are sorry and they’ll refund the remaining £30 within the next 3 days. When I pointed that it should be fair and reasonable that I get a 20% discount voucher from my next flight price, they said this is something British Airways do not offer. "
340,"✅ Verified Review |  Singapore to Nassau via Heathrow. British Airways is becoming a dismal airline to fly with. I will start with the worst and shocking aspect of my flight from Heathrow to Singapore on Oct 23. There were bugs on the flight and I have bites all over my body at least at a dozen places. One can suffer the bad food, service / behavior of cabin staff but having one's health compromised is unacceptable. The toilets were filthy. I was in the paid premium seat (front row) and I could smell the toilet from there. The attitude of staff ranges of sweet to indifferent and curt sometime for no rhyme or reason. The food is inconsistent and becomes a pain when you are on a long haul flight because there are no options available. While flying from Nassau to Heathrow, the dinner was fine but the breakfast (I think it was a morning snack), consisted of a croissant which was a cold lump, coffee which was cold and a oats snack bar. I mean, you cant get a croissant right? The inflight entertainment was mediocre at best and remains much to be desired. The screens in the Singapore- Heathrow sectors were ok to use but the Heathrow to Nassau sector were malfunctioning all the time. I could feel the fingers of the passengers sitting behind me trying to function the 'touch screen'; more like punch screen. The flights were mercifully on time and full marks for that this time. It could learn well from airlines like Singapore Airlines which are pretty consistent and clean. I am giving the airline 4 of 10 only for value for money."
341,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Madrid. British Airways monopoly of the routes to Spain have a serious impact on the quality. BA owns Iberia so there’s no competition. Planes are the worst of the BA fleet, check-in is a nightmare because they operate each other’s flight, but the online check in does not recognize each other’s booking references. Really the worst of BA and Iberia worlds together."
342,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Zurich. A budget airline at premium prices. Lots of late and cancelled flights. Pay for luggage, food and drinks. Poor customer services even at Silver level. I have had flights cancelled in the past and after a long time on the phone offered an alternative flight from another airport. No assistance for transport."
343,"✅ Verified Review |  Bari to Gatwick. More of the same. All held together by cockpit crew. Follows my review of the outbound leg a week back. Check in excellent, not BA staff and security at Bari a breeze. Boarding well organised. Cabin crew chatting to each other as I boarded and ignored me. This is inexcusable. Flight fine, ahead of schedule and good updates from cockpit. Didn’t buy anything this time, smell of coffee far better than the taste from previous experience. Gatwick South unpleasant tho not BA’s fault. Endless staircases, broken escalator and a long walk to security where half the e-gates were out of action. Baggage hadn’t arrived anyway despite being priority so delay at security irrelevant. Had an offer to upgrade to Club for £89 - a joke as there is no lounge at Bari and the onboard value is a max of £30. I do still like flying BA as much as I don’t Easy or Ryanair. But sinking to their levels will put BA out of business for short haul. There is now little differentiator."
344,"✅ Verified Review |  Early morning 0710 flight London Heathrow to Gibraltar. Now I know that British Airways have started charging for food and drink on European flights but their service levels are dropping so low that they are now no better than Ryanair or Easyjet. It might be M&S food, but if you can't get any that does not help. We were seated at the rear of the cabin, since BA started to charge I have noticed that there is only 1 food cart which started at the front. Before there would have been 2 with 1 at the front and 1 at the rear, now by the time the cart get to you it is 1.5 hrs into the flight and they have run out of most things. This flight was early morning and they had bacon rolls on the menu which were going to be their best seller and it sells out. Pros - 23kgs cabin bag allow best in the business."
345,"✅ Verified Review |  Pisa to Gatwick. I fly this route often as I have a home in Tuscany. Believe me it does not get any better - but the option is Ryanair and that's worse. Flight started in the new South Terminal lounge. The decor and layout of the facility is great. No problems here although it's located in a ""not so easy place"" to find. Breakfast food was ghastly. Cheap baps with greasy bacon or a dried up ""eggy"" thing. Horrible. Didn't touch it and those that did - left it as confirmed by numerous plates with half eaten baps. Had tinned fruit salad and yoghurt plus a G&T. Yes I know, bit early in the day! Short walk to the gate. Plane left on time. the usual horrible 3 for 2 seats in Club Europe. The front row made it easier - but only just. Had a pleasant lunch of chicken and couscous salad. The plane was very old. This was confirmed by the WC. Originally the loo flush button was blue. After 100,000 + uses the blue was partly eroded by finger presses, to a grey colour. The loo basin cannot be described here. Plane landed on time. The Captain came out and I had a nice chat with him. Very nice bloke. Return flight started in the shared lounge. It okay but can get busy. Same plane back (recognizable by the flush button in the loo - unless all the BA319s are like it). Skipped the meal as I'd eaten lunch in Pisa. It looked nice though. A few gin and tonics to suppress my irritation at what a shoddy product Club Europe is. Great flight back into the setting sun. FAs on all flights were great. Morale very low thanks to the miserable, mean cost cutting by the BA CEO, Mr Cruz, who has no idea on how to run an airline. I first flew BA in 1980 and what a difference. Decline is sad and depressing to see as verified by 80% of reviews here be so negative. Time to find a new CEO I think."
346,"✅ Verified Review |  Las Vegas to London Heathrow. This particular Boeing 747-400 must have been one resurrected from storage in the desert. The condition of this aircraft was appalling. The First Class cabin was literally falling apart with loose / yellowed bins, and filthy carpets. The entertainment system was old and slow, and low definition. The Premium Economy cabin was directly behind First Class, and those passengers kept using the First Class toilets. It didn't matter, because they were filthy. The dinner in First Class was inedible. British Airways are now a national embarrassment. British Airways are at best a three star airline, and maybe even a two star carrier compared to their competitors."
347,"✅ Verified Review |  London City to Edinburgh. Flight left on-time and arrived early. Impressed with the legroom on the Embraer 190 (much more comfortable than BA's A320s). Check-in, security and boarding all went smoothly and quickly. Cabin crew were efficient. Light snack and drink provided on this short flight. Would fly with BA again on short sectors, and LCY is an excellent airport to use."
348,"✅ Verified Review |  Faro to Gatwick. Check in was quiet at the club Europe desk and I was very quickly booked in. Fast track security at the airport wasn’t particularly well managed, although I did get through quicker than I would have otherwise. Disappointingly British Airways do not provide any lounge access at Faro, and there is currently a lot of construction taking place in the main departure lounge, and the builders are not exactly considerate with the noise! There was no priority queue at the entrance to the gate and as usual British Airways did a fairly half hearted job at ensuring priority boarding of the aircraft itself. The aircraft was the new style, which I think is very smart and nicely decorated (not budget airline as some commentators like to say), and whilst the legroom isn’t amazing I am 6’ tall and was quite comfortable and having the extra table space makes it a more usable space. The cabin crew were very friendly and professional whilst also being very efficient. A bar service with nuts was delivered soon after take off along with the menu for the flight. All of the cold parts of the meal and the drinks were excellent, sadly the chicken main was quite overcooked leading to dry chicken and soggy veg. That being said it tasted very nice. Arriving into Gatwick was a dream, especially for a large airport. Although the buildings are quite old and not laid out as well as newer ones, they have done a fantastic job at modernising it and making security very quick. It took a little while for bags to reach the belt but priority bags all came out first so the process was fairly painless. I got a good deal on the flight so I would say it was reasonably good value for money, although the experience in Faro airport does reduce the premium feel considerably."
349,"✅ Verified Review |  Los Angeles to London Heathrow. The inflight entertainment was not working so no tv, video, music or radio. USB socket not working. Headphones not working. Customer service very poor. Cabin crew seemed to be unaware that they were carrying paying passengers upon whom their jobs depend. Food mediocre. There was no apple juice or tomato juice on the dinner trolley and the cabin crew didn't bother to fetch any. Tea served with breakfast was luke warm and stewed. No refreshments supplied unless collected from the galley It took 2 days to get through to customer relations, many calls cutting off after 18 minutes +, others cancelled after going through options. I cannot recommend British Airways who in my case certainly did not fly to serve. The experience was far below expectations and definitely at the lower budget range for customer service. As the British flag carrier the experience was shameful, my last flight with this airline."
350,"✅ Verified Review |  Malaga to Gatwick. They've introduced new cabin baggage allowances. Ultimately that means everyone tries to jam their huge cases into the overhead lockers, resulting in a Ryanair-like scuffle. They now charge for food. This would be fine if it didn't take the single food trolley the entire duration of most short haul flights to get all the way down the plane. On my previous three flights with 'the new BA' we've been left for over an hour and a half (the last flight was actually over two hours) without any service. As the economy passengers are not allowed to use business class toilets, there was a long queue of passengers stuck behind the trolley desperately trying to get to the toilets at the back of the plane. On the other end of the trolley a whole bunch of passengers waiting for a scrap of food and drink two hours after take off. The cabin crew seem genuinely fed up. One of the key reasons for flying BA was their friendly cabin crew service. This has now been absolutely and totally undermined by the company, giving them no time (or energy, by the look of it) to be nice. Ultimately, if price is everything make sure you check Norwegian before you spend any money with BA. If price isn’t everything don’t fly BA."
351,"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Bangkok. Was looking forward to eventually flying with British Airways after flying reguarly to Bangkok with other airlines - how disappointed I was. A low budget product with a premium price. I will never again use this airline, its the most costly option (usually) for my regular journey to Thailand, but it ranks the lowest of all the airlines I've used on this route in past 30 trips. Seatback screen so small and of poor quality, service is dreadful, seats are old with no powerpoints, no wifi on board. Best part of the trip was getting off. Absolutely shameful for a national carrier of the UK. Lower your costs BA as you really are budget - go fly with any of the Gulf airlines or a vast majority of Europe's best, BA are nowhere near good enough. Current price almost a 3rd more than the other 2 direct flights (EVA and Thai) to Bangkok and British Airways is only half as good as those."
352,"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Bari. Employees who do not care for passengers. Queued at Club bag drop. Only 3 desks open, one busy, one with two staff talking, one with staff looking at screen. Barely greeted when it was my turn, just asked if I’d checked in on line. Cursory greeting at lounge. Ignored by cabin attendant on boarding - he pushed past me to talk to ground staff. Good on time flight with usual impeccable pilot. Bought a coffee - dreadful apparently artisan coffee. Almost no eye contact with cabin crew. Flight was a good price."
353,"✅ Verified Review |  Malaga to Gatwick. Our return trip from holiday was equally pleasant. Check-in at Malaga was a breeze although security was packed even though a quiet Sunday. VIP lounge at Malaga used by BA and other airlines (apparently its the only one there) is pretty useless compared with the old BA lounge that used to be there - cost cutting ?? Guess we were spoiled by Gatwick !! Drink okay but limited, food pretty awful but seating comfortable and it is very spacious. Flight left on time and again arrived half an hour early due I guess to help from Hurricane Ophelia which I guess we were on the fringe of. In board catering and drinks up to the usual quality and very pleasant crew - chatted to the First Officer, nice man. All in all we were well looked after in this Class so can't complain."
354,"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Malaga. First flight with BA from new home at South Terminal at London Gatwick. Upon arrival at check-in at 6:30 a.m was a bit disappointed to see few staff available to deal with Business class passengers resulting in a 20 minute wait to sort out our bags. However, Fast Track through Customs was efficient and made up for the earlier minor irritation. New lounge in South Terminal is spacious and food and beverages up to the usual good quality, although sadly, the reduction towards a cheap airline is showing in the cracks. A319 to Malaga was uneventful and onboard food was well presented and of good quality. We arrived 30 mins ahead of schedule due to fortunate winds so cannot complain. Overall flight quality has to be excellent."
355,"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Nice. Deliberate extortion by BA in my opinion. I booked an economy basic return from Nice to London with BA. Days before the outbound I had to make a change to the outbound flight and go a day earlier. I ended up buying a new single outbound flight as BA app crashed when i tried to change or cancel just the original outbound flight. In the UK I received a medsage that my return flight was ready for check in from BA. However app again gave up and said I had logged in too many times. Upon arrival at Heathrow I was told BA had cancelled my return booking as i had multiple bookings. They said I had to pay approx £350 to buy a new single ticket home, even after I explained my situation. I argued that had I been informed that they had cancelled my flight 5 days ago when they did I could have at least bought a cheaper flight. Even the day before when I got the check in open message would have allowed me to book cheaper. Eventually the customer relations manager offered a ticket for £122 (charging me again for taxes). As i needed to get back and there was no time to go to Gatwick for cheaper flight I had no choice but to pay. Terms and conditions may well tell that flight will be cancelled but when I asked ticket person how many people he thinks read t&c he said he would not like to comment. "
356,"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Orlando return. Worst ever long-haul Business Class flight.  We have experienced many airlines and many different classes of travel over the years but this most recent flight highlights the depths to which British Airways have descended (not the world’s favourite airline by far). We have never liked BA’s Business Class (Club World) seats since they changed over to the Yin-Yang layout of 8 seats across the cabin. The seat layout together with the poor service, meant we can honestly say this was the worst ever long-haul Business Class flight we have experienced. To this day I have never understood how from a health and safety viewpoint the CAA regulators ever allowed this seat configuration in the first place. Unless you are sat in an aisle seat, cabin crew have to reach over other passengers to pass hot drinks/meals which is just ridiculous. (True this happens in other seat classes as well but usually at a less precarious angle and generally not from behind your head!) In order to get out of the centre seats (rows E and F) and the window seats you have to climb over another passenger’s feet if they have their foot rest down and seat reclined. In the dimmed cabin lighting this is tricky and potentially dangerous; as a minimum you normally end up kicking the passenger you are climbing over. We are both able bodied but anybody less mobile would really struggle to get out into the aisle for whatever reason. You almost feel imprisoned in the centre seats and you are often also ignored because the cabin crew just pass by quickly, often from behind you so by the time you notice them, they have gone. We should not have to use a call button just to get basic service. The return leg was a night flight, the service overall was very poor, the crew just wanted to turn the lights down ASAP. The service at breakfast was also poor, the offerings were inconsistent. My wife struggled just to get an orange juice on her side of the cabin, whereas I at least got that but struggled to get a second cup of coffee. The entertainment system was archaic (very few recent film titles), the small screen resolution was very poor; this aircraft was delivered to BA in March 1999 and it shows its age. This flight might have been a few hundred pounds cheaper than competitors but in future we will pay the extra to get a decent seat and service. BA are only getting away with retaining these dreadful seats versus aisle access for everybody because the corporate passenger market is letting them. It is obvious if your employer is paying and says you can either choose to have an economy seat or one of those dreadful business class seats, you will obviously choose the business class seat and put up with the difficulties and poor service. It will be marginally better than being seated at the back; but that does not make it right. We will probably never fly BA long-haul business class (Club World) again while we are paying for the tickets unless they stop being so arrogant and re-configure their seating!"
357,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Abu Dhabi. I told BA at check-in that I would be interested in upgrading to Premium Economy if a window seat was available. The lady replied ""can I check - you are only interested in upgrading if there is a window"". I replied yes. After a series of phone calls, the upgrade was processed (I paid 149 GBP). My seat had no window or view at all as that seat is situated at the back of Premium Economy where the toilets should be. When I complained, I was told that seats could not be guaranteed so I had no complaint. No refund offered, no token gesture offered, nothing. The food was nice and the seat was very comfortable. If it wasn't for the rude customer service I would fly again. I was led to believe I could pay for a window seat and I paid in good faith. I've flown BA for years, but this year has been disappointing. I won't fly with them again."
358,"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Faro. Pretty good flight all round, and as ticket was bought in sale with car hire as well, it worked out good value. Check in area at south terminal is very nice and I was checked in very quickly, with fast track security equally quick. The new BA lounge is really well decorated and laid out with lots of nice and varied seating, interesting light fixtures and good views of the tarmac. It was early morning and breakfast was served, which was reasonably good. Although the hot options were just bacon roll, omelette roll or porridge which felt quite limited. Staff were all excellent. Boarding was quick, cabin crew friendly although no pre flight drink at all offered. This was an older aircraft with the old style seating, but the aircraft was clean and didn’t show much sign of age. The seats are comfortable enough, although legroom is not amazing. I was lucky enough to be in the front row so had more than most. The cooked breakfast was actually fairly good I think, nothing world shattering but decently cooked and fairly good quality ingredients. Disembarkation was quick enough, although bags took quite a while. Priority baggage didn’t seem to count for a lot, and annoyingly my priority bag tag had come off and ended up being one of the last bags. Overall a good flight."
359,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Madrid in economy class. Late booking and quite an expensive ticket to fly from Heathrow. Online check in and no luggage to check in so airport process was okay. Boarding quite efficient. Cabin was dirty - carpets, table and windows all unpleasant and cannot believe a cleaner set foot from the earlier flight. Everything pay onboard if you want to eat or drink, choice okay in brochure but the speed for serving this was awful. Staff seemed to have real problems with all card payments, and became bad tempered towards those of us wanting to buy. I wouldn't have minded on a cheap ticket, but this was not a true case of rip-off BA in 2017. Will avoid if possible."
360,"✅ Verified Review | I was told on the Saturday that my hand luggage was fine (the right size) by BA staff at Geneva airport - it was physically inspected. Then, on Monday, I was ordered to pay £65 (83 Francs). Staff at the airport were insanely rude (to be honest, the supervisor particularly). Their customer service is also awful. It's a joke of an airline compared to competitors like Qatar. When filing a complaint, they did not respond for 3 weeks. They only responded when I chased them up, said waiting time is actually 4 weeks. Can you believe that? The explanation was their IT system failed in May 2017, an internal matter which they clearly still not resolved."
361,"✅ Verified Review |  Grand Cayman to London. I can't comprehend is why a flight that sums up to about 12 hours of travel across the Atlantic Ocean, only allows 1 check in free bag for economy class. Upon returning to GCM from LON on October 6, 2017, I had to pay £290 for additional baggage.  Particularly for university students (such as myself) who migrate from such distances to achieve good education.  In addition to the disgusting rates for additional baggage, has BA gotten so cheap that they no longer provide a complimentary travel toothbrush, toothpaste & eye mask for 12 hour flights? That was one of the things I appreciated most about BA as it made me feel valued. I am truly disappointed with BA these days and whenever the day comes that another airline travels directly to LON from GCM you guarantee I WILL abandon BA!"
362,"✅ Verified Review |  Sydney to Paris via London, after flying with them I have to admit it's probably the worst airline I have been flying. When I boarded the plane, I notice some ketchup on the window and wall next to my. I assume for long distance flight airlines should provide you a mask for you to sleep, ear plugs, maybe a small tube of toothpaste. Here you have some headphones and that's all. With British Airways, you can order some special meals. I received my first low callries meal as expected but they could not find the breakfast. One of the cabin crew asked me if I ordered a special meal. The plane looked quite old. I tried BA, never again."
363,"✅ Verified Review |  Larnaca to London Heathrow, the return trip from our holiday. BAs product was more like a 'posh' Ryanair style of product even down to the asking for donations towards their charity. There were a few noticeable differences on the aircraft there was in-flight entertainment if you were in a seat where you could view the TV screen. On Ryanair, Easyjet and other low cost airlines you can pay using cash but no on BA it is card payment only in sterling. The aircraft was clean and tidy but overall the main BA product has gone downhill and the service standards have slipped. Comparing this flight to my recent flights from London City with BA Cityflyer, there is a vast standard in the cabin service standards."
364,"✅ Verified Review |  Funchal to Gatwick. Due to adverse weather, our return flight was delayed three days. When we did fly, the cabin crew appeared totally unaware of the fact that the passengers had had a difficult and frustrating time. They were totally unsympathetic and provided a chaotic service throughout the flight. The catering service was absymal, no choice of hot meal; hardly a bar service and no tea/coffee - I suspect although the aircraft arrived empty from LGW, they hadn't fully loaded the food & drinks trolleys. In contrast to the outgoing flight, this was a flight to be endured - just shows what a difference the crew can make."
365,"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to Gatwick. The staff that looked after us flying out to Florida and home were outstanding, on the way home the seating had been already arranged and my seat was separate from my two children, I was really worried about flying home away from my children, I spoke to the flight supervisor who kindly asked two passengers if they would switch seats which they were happy to do. The seats were very good and went back enough so you were able to get to sleep, the only thing we weren’t to happy with was the movies but I guess you can’t have everything. All in all I would book to fly with BA again and would highly recommend."
366,"✅ Verified Review |   Flew Leeds Bradford to Geneva via London Heathrow. British Airways certainly shocked me with the budget low cost style. My bag was 23.1 kg (0.1kg over the limit). This meant I had to pay for two bags whilst only having one. When I asked to take one item out and put it in my carry on to avoid paying an extra £25 or so, the answer was no, which was odd considering the bag was on the belt right infront of me. On board the aircraft boarding was prompt, a clean sleek cabin. I was seated near the back close to the toilet, which wasn't a problem. Beverage service was okay, everything was over priced, I bought a ginger ale for £2 and it was a cup, which shocked me as it was advertised as a full size can. The only thing that was free on board was water, for an international service on quite an expensive ticket it was a little disappointing. The crew were friendly and helpful but I couldn't help but overhear the crews conversation in the galley on descent into Switzerland. What they were talking about was inappropriate, especially how loud they were talking with children nearby. Apart from those things the flight was on time, punctual and served the purpose which I paid for."
367,"✅ Verified Review |  Los Angeles to Doha via London. Great staff, poor food and stupid cabin layout. I’m spoilt flying gulf airlines, but this time I tried a rear facing “internal” 4 of 345 configuration. Firstly, staring in the face of my two new best friends (seats facing forward) was at best weird, and at worst like a business class speed dating experience. Crew could barely serve me, ventilation was restricted and access 100% blocked by the foot rests of forward facing passengers. Once the security screens went up I felt like I was in some sort of flying crypt and was tempted to assume brace position to give the impression I had died and was on a viewing. The food was embarrassing bad - bigger serves of economy style food in bigger economy style bowls. BA, you have great crew trying to do their best with silly cabin engineering and poor catering support."
368,"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Istanbul. British Airways is quite clearly in decline and with utter contempt for its customers, even loyal ones who have status like myself. The overall feeling is of an airline that is miserly and skimping and greatly removed of the image that they try to portray of being a premium airline. Galleries South in T5 is large, airy and well equipped and clean and was not too busy on the Sunday I travelled. Drinks are well stocked but from the catering it is evident this is an airline scraping to do the bare minimum in what it offers - the quality lacking with minuscule portions for breakfast and loading up of cheap carbs and curtailing of premium ingredients. Onboard it is similarly tired, the plane had not been cleaned and my seat had food debris from the previous flight and stains on the tray table. Seating is cramped. The cabin crew look dejected and have low morale. Onboard experience the service is no different, than flying easyJet, in fact I would argue worse. There is no complimentary catering, you are subjected to M&S sandwiches. It is not cheap and or good value or any better than LCC offerings. Service is slow and took the whole of 4.5 hours of the flight - meaning difficulty to going to the toilet due to the trolley blocking the aisle - I was even asked to wait until I was finished which is ludicrous given it took the whole flight to serve people. The slow service is due to the use of card only payment, and also the fact the supplier doesn't allow their chilled items to be on the trolley which means the ridiculous scenario of cabin crew constantly running to the galley to fetch items and further slowing it down. On the return journey its clear BA doesn't care about its European or non-North American routes - the lounge was a contract lounge which was very subpar, in fact it was dark dingy and furniture filthy, but least the food was decent. Overall if it wasn't for the fact I flew with FF miles and the low tax on redemptions within Europe, I would never actually pay the full cash fare for this airline - you get better more efficient service on the likes of EasyJet now within Europe with no difference in overall product now complimentary catering has been removed."
369,"✅ Verified Review |  Toronto to London in Premium Economy and onto Oslo in Economy. Easy check in and in the lounge within 15 mins. The usual selection of dry sandwiches, and a chicken noodle soup (minus the chicken and noodle). The lounge was clean with plenty of staff clearing away. Efficient boarding with sparking wine/soft drinks offered. Early departure, fast drink service and dinner before lights out. There was no breakfast (previously scrapped) with the cereal bar now also gone. Early arrival, a short wait for a shower in the North Lounge, followed by an ok breakfast. An early departure and an average flight on a A319. Long queues for the bathroom (only one now for all of economy as the other was removed to provide 2 more seats) with slow buy on board service though at least they made it to the last row mainly down to little take up of food or drink. Early arrival though a long wait for bags. Oslo to London on a A320 was verging on a farce, A full flight, selfish use of the overheads delayed departure whilst crew looked for space. The buy onboard came out quickly with one and then the second handheld machine dying at the first row served. Service ground to a halt whilst the crew tried to get either machine back into life, broke out the paper visa slips, took the cart back in, re-appeared 20 mins later so service started an hour into the flight. Little take up as people had given up including me as there was little time left to enjoy the purchases. The crew tried really hard, put a brave face on and kept going. The organisation and concept of the BA buy on board is a disgrace. Though a third party provides the food and card machines, the choice, stock holding and the reliability of payment machines means the service is a farce.  I don't understand why BA continue to struggle with this service as Easyjet, Ryanair and low cost carriers seem to have have to cracked it and got their act together. Early arrival and fast bags completed the flight. Final flight home to Toronto was good, the club lounge at the B gates remains quiet, clean and an oasis to relax and eat/drink before flying. The 787 was towed to the gate 45 mins before departure and was never going to leave on time. At the gate, the experience was enhanced with an upgrade to business class. Service was really slow on boarding I had to ask for champagne, and the underwhelming bag of toiletries and shades only offered after take off. We pushed back over 30 late. No signs of life from crew for another 30 mins, though a positive enhancement was tray service for drinks which felt more classy than a cart. The main of steak was excellent and looked to be on new crockery and plated after cooking (no dried gravy or potato around the edges). Afternoon tea remains underwhelming with no scones and only three sandwiches still wrapped in plastic. Overall, the decline in service seems to have stopped with some minor improvements. The crew on all four flights were pleasant but lacking confidence and experience. The desire to do things by the book results in slow and wooden service at times. Other than the farce of buy on board, I was pleased there appeared to be no further decline in service. "
370,✅ Verified Review | My early morning flight from Gatwick to Malaga was a very pleasant experience overall. The flight departed on time and was staffed by competent and amiable and very experienced cabin crew. Announcements were clear and friendly. However there was no route map and many of the snacks listed on the Marks and Spencer to buy menu were not available at all. I must mention that the cost of the luggage was outrageous and off putting.
371,"✅ Verified Review |  Athens to London. Slowest baggage drop service I have ever experienced. I spent a whole hour waiting to drop my bag (queue for people who have already checked in). I seriously do not understand how they can be so slow. People have already checked in, they just need to leave a bag. The company really needs to look after their processes"
372,"✅ Verified Review |  A return British Airways flight from London to Sofia was a service of 2 halves. The outboard leg was very good from London to Bulgaria, the check in was swift and efficient, boarding the flight was simple and quick. The 2 bag on the flight policy was enforced and stowing bags on the plane was quick. Disembarking off the plane was straight forward and easy. The flight was worth a good 8 out of 10. The return flight from Sofia to London was the opposite. Check in was slow and not inefficient. There was no priority boarding of the plane and it was a Ryanair type of scramble to board the plane. The 2 bag on the flight policy was not enforced so many people got on the flight with a roller bag, a rucksack and then a small holdall! The 5 cabin crew had a nightmare experience trying to stow all the bags before take off. Once airborne the M&S service was sold out before halve of the economy cabin was served. With only drinks and crisps available towards the end. Finally disembarking the plane was a slow and drawn out affair as passengers where trying to locate their 3 bags while holding up the isle. Overall I would give this leg 4 out of 10."
373,"✅ Verified Review |  Geneva to London. British Airways used to be my favourite airline, however, over the last 2 years I have experienced some appalling service in pretty much every flights I have had with them. I do fly with BA about 30 times a year. In this specific occasion my flight was cancelled for apparent adverse weather (this being in the middle of summer in a time where the weather was excellent in both my departure/arrival cities) I was told abput this the day before in the afternoon bearing in mind I was flying at 7am the morning after. Their communication was made via text including a number to call back to re arrange my flight. I must have call that number about 30 times without success as the lines were too busy. When I managed to connect I have had to hold for an hour before the line died. I have only managed to speak to them at 11pm that day when they told me they placed me on a flight 4.5 hours later. Horrible customer service by the way, the person I was talking to couldn't care less. I was originally flying in business and I was placed in economy instead. I was told that there was no compensation for the delay because it was due to the weather conditions (a lie of course as the weather was still amazing in both countries) and promised a refund on the fare which to date (about 4 months later) has still not happened. If you call them they transfer your call to India where if you are lucky you spend an hour waiting to end up speaking to someone unable to help. What once was the best airline is now worse than Ryanair. Avoid if possible"
374,"✅ Verified Review | BA used to be a nice airline with great customer service, those days are long gone. If you fly in their ""business class"" you will get what you used to get in economy 5 years ago: same leg space, same food, same drinks. Forget about a welcome drink before take off, 3 course dinner (was offered a chicken club sandwich on my last flight) and personalized service. Economy class is just like easyjet or Ryanair, but you will pay much less for the latter ones. Shame."
375,"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to New York. After reading reviews I was hoping some were inaccurate, but after this flight in Club World I realise that BA has fallen even lower than many have said. Check in at T5 was interminably slow with one of the most arrogant staff I have encountered for years. The lounge was crowded and dirty, and the food selection is terrible for a premium facility. Onboard, seats are old and tatty, cramped and uncomfortable and offer no privacy whatsoever. The food was passed across my neighbours seat to reach me, and what a lousy offering this was - below many airline economy meal standards. IFE screen was not working properly, fuzzy and very poor. Cabin crew were polite and trying to be friendly, but they certainly hide in the galley as soon as they can and judging from the standard of the toilets towards the end of the flight, they do not see it as part of their job to maintain these. Luckily, I am leaving the USA to Asia from Los Angeles next week on Eva Air and expecting a big step up in standards. "
376,"✅ Verified Review |  Port of Spain to Gatwick via St. Lucia was a good experience. I don't have any complaints regarding the seat quality or flight attendants, who did a very good job during the flight on keeping the passengers safe and serving meals and drinks. The seat was comfortable enough, a bit wider than on low cost flights, I had extra space and as I noticed the leg room between seats was regular. I had a seat behind the bulkhead with enough leg room. There was a minor issue, the flight had a stop at St. Lucia, after which the new flight attendants insisted on waking up the people on the front row, opened their entertainment system screens, to show them the safety video which was shown about an hour and a half on take off from Port of Spain. I told them it's not necessary to view the video again and actually the video was not available this time, so this would be something the management should look into. In-flight entertainment was good, with no advertising, which pleased me a lot. I had a jolly passenger next to me in the middle seat, who had a bit too much to drink and moved a lot in the seat, sometimes talked louder than necessary, but he was still fun to have around and the flight attendants made sure in a very polite and funny way that he does not disturb the other passengers. There were minor issues during check-in at the departure airport in Port of Spain, the BA staff forgot to put a priority tag on my bag and give me a voucher for the lounge as I have a gold card on Oneworld. To use the lounge I had to use my Priority Pass not to waste time until the matter was cleared with the ground staff. I was flying further from Gatwick to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines, hoping I would not have to change airports in London and as a result go through immigration, take the baggage out, check-in again, pass immigration and security again, but BA doesn't have an agreement with Turkish Airlines and I had to go through this lengthy process."
377,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Chicago. Simply appalling. Aircraft was old configuration B-747-400 with Premium Economy adjacent to First Class. Cabin was filthy, and carpets coming up. Food was inedible. The IFE system was old, slow, and low resolution. No wireless of course, either. British Airways senior executives should be forced to endure this awful service, and sample it themselves. For them to call it ""First Class"" is insulting, demeaning, and arrogant in the extreme. These old aircraft need to be replaced with the lovely A380, and the entire First Class and Club Class product should be reviewed / enhanced. But of course, this will never happen whilst this airline has a virtual monopoly across the Atlantic. "
378,"✅ Verified Review |  Jersey to Gatwick. Flight left on time and the plane was clean and modern. The crew were friendly. The flight was only 40 minutes and the crew worked hard to try and serve everyone who wanted to buy food or drinks but I’m not sure they made it to the final rows. I think the problem is that there are only 2 staff to service the economy cabin whereas on our EasyJet flight out there had been 4 staff (as there is no business class). I still don’t think the buy on board is working that well, but that is not the crew’s fault. We were pleased to arrive 20 minutes early although it was a shame to have to get a bus to the terminal. The BA offering is now on a par with low cost carriers and as we got a competitive price for this flight we were fairly happy."
379,"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Tirana. Full flight on both outward and return journey. The seating was adequate for a short journey but only limited pitch. The aircraft was clean. Cabin crew were present and friendly throughout the journey but busy selling food and on board goods. The main advantage of this airline was the direct flight from UK to Tirana, otherwise nothing special to recommend. Both flights on time."
380,✅ Verified Review | I booked British Airways to travel under the assumption it was a quality carrier not a low cost carrier. I expected a meal and baggage to be included. I was unaware of the brand changes and was very disappointed after I booked. This airline is no longer quality with the prices they charge. Expect a budget airline experience here. Staff were very friendly and helpful however. Pilot also chatty throughout the flight giving us lots of info.
381,"✅ Verified Review |  Kuala Lumpur to Berlin via London. Aircraft long haul new and clean, short haul a bit old, but still acceptable. Crew overall are lovely, pleasant service. BA food is on the top of the rank. Kuala Lumpur to London My boyfriend and I got beef stew and chicken satay as dinner and beef omelette as breakfast. Also very tasty. We got 2 wines and so many juices. Return flight was chicken curry and pesto pasta. Again, it flavorful. And we got beef congee and Engliah breakfast before we landed. Short hauls don't have any food. Inflight entertainment not the best, but still acceptable. Short hauls don't have any screens. Only thing I don't like is the seats. Economy seats are small. I have no problem with it since I am a petite girl, but still very uncomfortable to sit straight up. If I knew before, I will book a premium economy, that one seems nicer and have more space. I got the best price for round trip, value for money!"
382,✅ Verified Review |  I flew from Brussels to London Heathrow on an A320. The aircraft was about three quarters full. Boarding was smooth and we left and arrived slightly early. The sale of food and drinks went well and didn't appear to have much of a take up on this flight of less than an hour. Crew were good.
383,"✅ Verified Review |  I flew from London Heathrow to Sofia and back. The plane on both flights was an Airbus 321 and I’d guess a young one judging by the freshness of the interior. I am 1.82m (6 feet) tall and found the leg room and seat width to be fine – I certainly didn’t feel cramped even in the centre seat. Both flights departed the gate on schedule (although actual take-off on the outbound flight was slightly delayed because of air traffic restrictions over Europe). The cabin crew on both legs were pleasant and courteous. On both flights, the captain kept us very well informed of our route and our progress. So far, top marks to British Airways but where they let themselves down is the shambles of a refreshment service. It might seem like a minor gripe but I do like the opportunity to get something to eat or drink on a flight even if I have to pay for it (which you do not on other legacy airlines like Lufthansa). The range and prices of food and drink on offer were comparable with low cost airlines I have flown with. But there the comparison ends because whilst I have always been served quickly (and sometimes twice) on short haul low-cost airlines, BA’s service is too slow and seems to run out of stock too. They also insist on card only transactions. I had the misfortune to be sitting toward the rear of the plane on both legs - and the A321 is a long plane. A single trolley started from the front, making ponderous progress towards me and even though the flight was two hours and forty minutes long, I only just managed to get a coffee and sandwich from a slightly harried flight attendant who by now had returned the trolley and was scuttling to and from the galley, squeezing past the long queue of passengers waiting for the lavatories. (The coffee, by the way, was excellent). The return flight was worse because the trolley made it two thirds down the aisle and was getting tantalisingly close to me before abruptly stopping and returning to the galley, leaving the remaining passengers unserved. In conclusion, clean plane, punctual service, pleasant cabin crew but awful refreshment service."
384,"✅ Verified Review |  Heathrow to Bilbao. Boarding of the flight at Heathrow was very good , the flight was on time and the plane was clean. Frequent flyers boarded first and the rest soon followed. From then on the service was very similar to a Easy Jet or Eurowings flight. The 3 crew member's in economy passed through the cabin selling M&S sandwiches , snacks and coffee. The flight out of Bilbao was delayed by a late incoming aircraft, information on the delay was a little slow in coming from the gate agent. However the crew were very efficient loading the flight when it finally landed. The flight crew also managed to shave 15 minutes off the flight time too. However the service onboard is similar to Eurowings. Both flights were safe and competent. But the actual flight experience was lacking and in future I will consider Easyjet or similar as they offer the same level of service for less money."
385,"✅ Verified Review |  Kalamata to London Heathrow. No priority boarding at Kalamata. Drink and food service poorly synchronised, with no pre-dinner drink, no nuts, and bread served with main course. Lacto-ovo vegetarian special included the same tomato and mozzarella starter as on the outbound flight despite a beetroot carpaccio dish being available on the standard menu. The special main was yet again a bland, overcooked pasta dish. Overall, a pathetic vegetarian offering. Cabin crew did the bare minimum in Club Europe and their main priority seemed to be selling the M&S stuff in economy, which they were doing up until 30 minutes from landing. The Club Europe toilet was grubby. Flight landed on schedule but there was a long wait for baggage at T5."
386,"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Krakow. I am a one world emerald member on AA so I get certain perks when flying British Airways such as free seat selection, lounge use and priority boarding - that makes this airline bearable - just. They are obsessed with carry on bags much like Ryanair giving out silly yellow tags for carry on bags and checking carry on sizes - not sure what it does for them as it only increases their bag handling costs. Their seats are no better than anyone else and their pitch just as tight. What used to set BA apart was their inflight service - even in coach a sandwich or something - this has degraded to nothing, zero - even a soft drink is charged. So I asked for water, I was offered an Evian for $5 - no thanks just plain water. Ok sir we will come back to you after we serve everyone else. Of course he never came back - 2.5 hour flight and not even allowed a cup of water. BA are listed as a 4 star airline,  AA are a 3 star yet AA now have better inflight service than BA by a country mile. BA are a bottom tier airline and nothing more to the average flier."
387,"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Abuja, Nigeria with British Airways. Departed on time, paid extra for legroom seat aisle side of exit door, don'0t bother as it has no pocket for documents, glasses etc.. Seat so narrow that you cannot move, seat cushion hard and old. Cabin crew comment, you have extra legroom arent you lucky ,my comment - yes and I paid for it when I asked about lack of pocket for my specs and passport. Food was bland. Arrived on time. Departing Abuja on return trip I had an aisle seat, again narrow and extremely uncomfortable. Old aircraft. Cost cutting squeeze in Economy will drive customers away as comparable airlines offer much more. Now the number and particularly the dimensions of the toilets have been reduced you can hardly fit into the toilet. Food on return trip was a so called breakfast, yellow mass called an omelette and some sort of potato fritter. Cabin crew went through the motions but seemed in a hurry to get service finished and to disappear. Return flight was on time. Punctuality was BAs saving grace."
388,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Tokyo Haneda. Boeing 777 was tatty inside, cabin items (seats, carpets, tables etc) worn, and dirty. Sticky surfaces, and hate to think what germs are being stored here. Meal standards are very poor compared to Lufthansa and ANA that I flew earlier this year, reflects the BA move to being budget standard airline at premium prices. Cabin staff were nice but even they cannot make up for how poor other areas have gotten at BA. Time to remove the low-cost airline minded CEO there now, and surely Skytrax must now downgrade them to 3 stars at best? "
389,"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Hong Kong. A really mixed experience. In the positive side, cabin crew were professional and polite. Cockpit announcements very informative. Flight on time, with ability to catch up for a delay at departure due to tech failure. In terms of hard product, I was a bit disappointed. The Premium economy cabin looks clean and smart but the seat is pretty hard and not so comfortable for a long night flight. Entertainment screen very slow to respond (happened to me to with another A380 from BA so means it's an issue with the hardware). Food is decent quality, but the presentation, at least in PE, could be improved. The luggage delivery has been a pain, 75 minutes from the landing to the delivery of the bags is too much, even for such a big airplane."
390,✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Alicante. Yesterdays flight was grim from the moment of arriving at our boarding gate and seeing two long lines of a stag and a hen party in various stages of drunkenness. Not really the company you feel safe being in a very confined space with and especially with a young baby. The language and behaviour became even more threatening as the drinks trolley ploughed up and down the aisle. Especially awful as we were confined to the smallest seating areas possible. It was all truly horrible and very disheartening as we had driven for hours to avoid these conditions in lesser aurlines. Previously we had had a lot of respect for British Airways standards now thoroughly destroyed.
391,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Kalamata. Slow boarding on this new BA destination in Greece. Club Europe seats uncomfortable for a 4 hour flight, particularly when the seat in front is inclined just before the meal service. No IFE. Cabin crew were professional and attentive throughout. Lunch service definitely improved, although the lacto-ovo-vegetarian main course was the usual bland, overcooked pasta. Arrival on schedule and through to car hire within ten minutes of landing. Overall, a reasonable flight, although Club Europe is poor value by competitors' business class standards."
392,"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Mauritius. Very disappointing airline and service. The facing each other seats are fun theoretically but when reality hits, it's a mess. Why? Because you get other people stumbling on your feet during mid-flight. Or is it just my luck and most the other passengers on business class were old and not flexible enough to jump over the foot stool and wake you mid-sleep every time they need to use the restroom? The TV monitors colors are so off. it was a nightmare trying to enjoy any movie. Getting the brightness right to make the colors work. Because if you don't want the monitor to blind you when it's snooze time, good luck watching the movie in any other color than black and red. The worst thing was the food - salad was frozen. The beef filet was so dry and flavorless but too salty. My partner's chicken was swimming in a pool of oil and flavorwise, it was hitting all the wrong spots. They believe in Umami and dump a ton of MSGs on their food to make it taste edible but did they get that wrong. I ended up eating bread and butter only. Same goes for the scrambled eggs for breakfast. Bacon was extra salty.  And the fresh fruit bowl was just as frozen as the salad. Overall, very poor and disappointing experience. "
393,✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to London. I am a regular BA flyer and so generally my expectation is low nowadays as they almost become a Tier 2 airline. The journey started in the Concorde lounge Dubai and it is a very small area with little food that in the two hours I was there was not refreshed. Onboard the 777 you begin to sense the jobs worth attitude of the staff who seem to permanently work to rule. Amazingly when the menu came it contained only an Arabic snack with no options. They say this is to allow maximum sleep. No other airline has done this. Breakfast was undercooked slop and it was inedible. It is incredible that you can spend 10000 usd on a ticket and you can't even get a meal. The airline is clearly failing fast and I wish now I had flown the luxury of Emirates at half the price. Very disappointing and they don't care.
394,✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Biarritz. Had a very nice flight with good cabin service and informative cockpit crew. First time to experience a 375 ml bottle of champagne on the drinks trolley which was chilled for me. Terminal 5 is a nice place to start any trip and would choose BA for my next holiday.
395,"✅ Verified Review |  London Gatwick to Funchal. In my opinion British Airways have got things badly wrong in the race to the bottom. For travellers in Economy BA are now just another budget carrier and not a very good one at that. They have failed to understand what their true market is all about. Generally if people want to use a cheap budget carrier they will use the likes of Ryanair or Easyjet. The BA brand has always been associated with the quality that a full service airline provides, but sadly not any more. The choice of food for sale to the economy passenger is not only poor but it's expensive. Frankly it must be embarrassing for the cabin crew to make announcements saying that the business class passengers will be offered a hot meal and free drinks but all those in economy must pay. And that assumes that from the enormous range of 2 types of sandwich on offer that there will be any left. On our flights to and from Funchal there was a single trolley for the entire economy cabin, in each case taking more than 2 hours to make it from the front to the back. Service could only have been any slower if the crew were trying to sell scratch cards along with the overpriced food and drink! Maybe that's in the next part of the BA master plan?! British Airways used to be a national carrier to be proud of but these days they are just an embarrassment, not a full service airline or a decent budget carrier, simply lost somewhere in the middle. As a fairly regular traveller of many years my preference would always been to travel with my national airline but this race to the bottom is driving me away. Don't BA management understand that there are many people who would gladly pay a little bit more for 'free' food and drink? Sadly I think we know the answer. All we need now is a bugle playing as the plane touches down and the sad transition from world class carrier to poor budget imitator will be complete."
396,"✅ Verified Review |  Zakinthos to London Heathrow. Poor check in at Zante airport. Not enough desks, slightly clueless staff. Mrs B had to deploy laser beams to get front row which was free. Slightly late departure and made to wait on hot bus for while before boarding. After that very good flight again. Much busier Club cabin than on way out so two staff but they were still very attentive. Beetroot carpaccio with Goats cheese, melt in mouth Ox Cheek, poor desert again. Again the crew were really good about helping my nervous wife with the female co-pilot coming out to chat. Not left wanting the whole flight. A bug bear on both flights were the economy passengers using the club toilet at will. This kept disrupting the cabin service and made my little one nearly have a problem because of the extra queues. One pays more for more toilets. Kids in dire need, ok, adults No! Time made up almost, T5 quite quick again so another good experience for us with BA. Cheers."
397,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew British Airways from Belfast City to London Heathrow. First time I flew from Belfast and it's a great little airport. I had access to the BA lounge, which for such a small airport is pretty good. It was an evening flight and there were a decent choice of cold sandwiches including: chicken, smoked salmon, egg, etc. The bar was well stocked including Fever Tree tonic and Grey Goose vodka. Champagne was available on request. Due to a flight delay our plane did not depart from the air bridge, but at gate 6, but we could access this gate using stairs from the lounge, this was managed well as we were given priority boarding before general boarding was announced in the main terminal. The flight was probably at 30% capacity so the FA had no problems serving passengers. The flight was delayed by 30 minutes but we made some time and was at the gate at Heathrow 20 minutes late. This was a last minute booking for business and was pretty expensive at £343 return. But as a Gold member I got most of the business class benefits."
398,"✅ Verified Review |  Toronto to London Heathrow and was very pleasantly surprised. BA Lounge in terminal 3 at Pearson is small but quiet compared to others. Great window seats overlooking tarmac. Separate meal service area prior to flight allowed me to focus on sleep during this red-eye that left at 22:00. Meal in lounge was buffet style but had a really good made to order noodle bar. Drink choices perfectly adequate. Staff very helpful and cordial. Flight left half an hour late but made up time and landed early. Cabin staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The seats must be the most talked about issue for BA club world. They do indeed ""pack them in"" compared to any other business class flight I have taken. That said, seats fully reclined, I had no issues with faulty equipment and it was very comfortable. Aside from take-off and morning meal service privacy screen never came down between me and fellow traveler. Cost of flight was 30-50% less than other business class options available to me so with this in mind experience was very good. As a side note connected on to Madrid and BA lounges at LHR are fantastic. W"
399,"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Zakinthos. From parking meet and greet to inside the Lounge via bag drop, security and three shops took only 50 minutes. Boarding on time, greeted warmly. Managed to grab the front row at online check in. From take off the Purser looked after the business cabin brilliantly. Drinks and nibbles out sharpish and refreshed without asking. Meal served quickly. Carpaccio of melon with a prawn, miso cod, not overcooked, wasabi mash and veg. Average dessert and cheese and crackers. Wine topped up regularly. Coffee in a mug. All through the flight staff looked after my nervous flyer wife and little four year old with great care and attention as well as the rest of the cabin. Priority offload and separate bus to terminal. Fairly quick passport control and bags coming onto the belt as we got through. The crew had been very kind and chatty with us and in good humor. Apart from delay in leaving Heathrow FAB."
400,Our flight on economy long distance from the Austin to Heathrow was the most uncomfortable we've had on any carrier and we have travelled extensively. The seats were so close together with hardly any leg room or arm movement that not only was it difficult to eat the food which was dreadful but very difficult to get in and out of without damaging or twisting a knee or back. We had extreme exhaustion on landing from discomfort and lack of sleep. The evening meal we were served was inedible. The pasta had been hanging around for some time by the appearance. It was dry and congealing in what was once tomato sauce. The foil container was bent and the foil cover crumpled which proves it had been handled and heated up frequently. As for the breakfast in a box it was so bad I cannot comment. We've had better food and seating on low budget airlines and as well as on Myanmar Airlines! We want to support our national airline but definitely not on BA economy. It seems all the attention and care is given to first and business class. A huge disappointment.
401,"BA 138 13/5/2015. BA 273 13/5/2015. Just completed my first BA Flight in Club World. The experience can be summed up in a single word - ""pathetic"". The flight taxied and took off with passengers sleeping with their seats flat in the centre ""couples seat"". The crew was totally indifferent. The light meal post take off was offered only to passengers in the aisle seats for reasons best known to the crew. If you are seated in the centre ""couple seats"" you have to be either an acrobat or a gymnast to access the toilets as you have to jump over a sleeping passenger in the aisle to get there. The buggy requested to transport us to the lounge at Heathrow as my wife had just had surgery showed up but the lady driving it decided we did not need it and walked off as a result we had to trek for 2 hrs to clear security and reach the lounge. Will never travel BA again."
402,LGW - Antigua - LGW. Easy check in at the Club World desk and then quickly through security etc. Unusually for BA at Gatwick boarding was very well organised and we were quickly on board the ageing 777 - 200. Water or orange was offered prior to take off along with a hot towel. We pushed back from the stand at exactly our departure time and were airborne about 10 minutes later. I can't say the seats were the most comfortable I have ever sat on but the extra leg room in PE did help. Two drinks rounds were served one before and one with lunch. The food was just about OK although I never have any great expectations so I am rarely disappointed. However the size and picture quality of the TV screens was very poor and as a result I decided to read for most of the journey. The cabin crew overall were very professional and as a result we had a good flight. The return flight was pretty much the same although despite being being bronze exec card holders we were refused permission to check in at the Club World desk which as it turned out didn't make any difference. Overall another good experience with BA bar the few issues that I have mentioned.
403,"19 April KWI-LHR BA157. LHR-EDI BA1454. 3 May EDI-LHR BA1459. LHR-KWI BA156. KWI-LHR-EDI-LHR-KWI: booked World Traveller Plus (Premium Economy) but upgraded to Club World (Business Class) on the outward trip. An excellent experience: as always the cabin crew make the difference. On all sectors professional well-turned-out staff who were genuinely friendly cheerful and helpful. Food was excellent (chicken or pasta seem to be a thing of the past - I was not offered either) nicely presented and for me in sufficient quantity. Water/orange juice runs on a regular basis washrooms clean and tidy and well-stocked A wide range of entertainment on the KWI-LHR sector (it kept me entertained for a 6-hour flight and because I flew out in April and back in May the selection had changed on the return flight). Smooth flights (the 747's on the KWI-LHR sector although old were well- maintained and everything worked - I really enjoy flying the ""Queen of the Skies"") and plenty of information from the flight deck. Slight delay outbound at Kuwait because of a technical problem but it was resolved: all other sectors were on time. I travelled on a Sunday in both directions so no delays in connections at Heathrow although I had built in sufficient time between flights to allow for delays when I booked my ticket. All in all four excellent flights - BA seem to have improved immensely since I last flew with them in 2014: the cabin crew and check-in staff seem to make the difference and for this reason I use BA in preference to the carriers from the Middle East especially as Terminal 5 at Heathrow is a very civilised place to transfer (at least in my experience)."
404,BA108 DXB-LHR Club World in seat 10G. Very nice seat no bother from anyone stepping over you and also right next to the loo and CW kitchen so great access to snacks. Also as I was at the front of the cabin I got off the plane nice and speedily. Food was good had a nice vegetarian pasta main course. Plus the afternoon tea I got offered plenty of scones as most people surprisingly didn't want them!
405,BRU-LHR-YYZ: CLUB Europe - Club World; This time again check-in was smooth with friendly ground staff the best croissant in this lounge. Boarding was easy friendly cabin crew was waiting for us to take jackets. Hot towels tasting breakfast landed on time. This short flight 10/10. Security in Heathrow was horror but I prefer the horror of waiting than the horror of terror. First lounge was a breeze. Boarding for the flight to Toronto was with busses driving us to the Dreamliner. Indeed the business seats are smaller. It really felt bad. The flight was not comfortable at all as I left the plane with pain in the back and shoulder. The crew were excellent the food was excellent and the screens are improved. But the space you have is really a shame. As a gold member I fly often business or first but the club world seats in the Dreamliner are really smaller and not comfortable at all. I will avoid this plane in future. I am so happy I will fly back in a 777.
406,LAX-LHR-LAX April return May 14. Another chance to try the A380 product and all seemed well online check in bag drop sensible loading on the air bridge at LAX but once we boarded a self important flight attendant decided she had to check the boarding passes to ensure we were on the right plane on the right day. No you do not we have been checked all the way along. Still even this pitiful attitude could not dampen the sterling job done by the pair of flight attendants we had. They gave Mixed Fleet a very good name. Now having got through everything needed on that trip we had the return. WTP so the food was OK the thing is during the trip the LAX sector had reverted back to the legacy staff. Disaster. The staff tried until around half way through the flight when a woman who spoke with a brogue I guess Eire arrived to take charge and declared the bar closed. So too were snacks of crisps etc. Half way through a long flight? BA claim the bar service and snacks are available throughout the flight. Clearly they are telling lies. This poor creature shut things because she had counted everything. Anyway if BA wish to lie to us we will not be buying from their High Life Shop. It cuts both ways. So to sum up most BA staff really do try to make passengers (the customers) enjoy the experience; certainly I have always flown BA where possible however when one employee on each sector can colour the experience in such a negative manner I shall not be rushing to fly them again. Closing the bar and snacks after less than six hours on a flight of over eleven hours? To Fly to be Self Serving.! I really can no longer recommend BA.
407,Outward from Heathrow 8th May BA543 to Bologna. Return 10th May BA545. Flew return LHR to BOL. It is a long time since I have flown with BA and I was reminded just how good they are. I really cannot fault any aspect of the journey from the check in staff to the cabin crew and seat comfort. Every aspect was highly professional. I was impressed with terminal 5 and think it creates an excellent first impression of Britain.
408,LHR to CPT in first (777 aircraft). Concorde room as always quiet and private with excellent bar service (we did not try the restaurant) and wonderful views from the terrace (plenty of natural light). Boarding by separate bridge. A warm welcome greeted by name and escorted to my seat by a smiling member of staff. Offered a glass of champagne wash bag and night suit. Departure and arrival on time. Food and beverages very good (excellent bloody Mary). Bed was made by staff with extra mattress provided. Very good level of comfort. Entertainment of good standard (in generally I prefer to sleep). Staff brilliant always smiling and discretely present to serve. Small hiccup no hot breakfast in the morning (no explanation given). Overall an excellent trip of very high standard with an impressive cabin crew.
409,CPT-LHR-MAD in club. Check-in in CPT quick and efficient. Lounge elegant with good choice of snacks and food and an excellent selection of South African wines. Boarding was announced in the lounge. Boarding a bit chaotic. Seated in the first class section of this old 747. Greeted by name and offered a glass of champagne by a charming member of staff. Departure and arrival on time. Food and beverages of high quality and standard. As I was traveling with my husband the table was set so that we could dine together by using the companion's ottoman. Entertainment ok-the very small screen of the old first class. The bed was made by the staff using an extra mattress. A good nights sleep in a comfortable bed. Cabin crew excellent always smiling and professional. LHR-MAD in a refurbished 321. Emergency exit seat with lots of space and comfort. Excellent cabin crew delivering an outstanding service with hot or cold breakfast for a very busy club Europe cabin. Greeted personally by the purser due to my frequent flyer status. Overall impression an excellent trip where a lot of attention to every detailed was paid. Indeed to fly to serve.
410,Flew MAN-LHR-YYZ and return. Outward in premium economy on a 777 there was plenty of leg room and a good entertainment system food was nice and plenty of options for drinks. Cabin crew good. Flew back from YYZ-LHR on 747 I was upgraded from premium economy to club world by the cabin crew which was excellent. Comfortable seat plenty of options for food and drink. Cabin crew attentive helpful and very friendly couldn't have asked for a better flight. Everybody seems to have a go at BA I find them reasonable priced and excellent to fly with.
411,Flew BA on open-jaw route BRU-LHR-LAX returning one week later SFO-LHR-BRU. BRU-LHR was on an A319 newly refurbished plane. I paid for seating selection weeks before. The day before on-line check-in opened I saw that some seats on the front of the plane became available to economy travellers with no surcharge so I took one of them to deplane as quick as possible (the plane landed a little bit ahead of schedule anyway). LHR-LAX on the A380 was a really nice experience really smooth flight and incredibly quiet upper-deck cabin. Food was not bad as long as you don't expect anything too fancy in economy. There was only one complete meal after take off and a pre- arrival snack before landing. On an 11 hours flight this may seem not enough but passengers are welcome to pick up snacks in the galley during the flight as well as having drinks fixed on demand. Only one negative spot of the flight: the cabin was really cold! SFO-LHR still on the A380 departed a little bit late due to a malfunction of one of the doors but crew kept us informed of the situation. Same nice experience nice crew and so on. LHR-BRU on an A320 departed late after being stuck on tarmac due to high departure rate at Heathrow. Once again the captain kept us informed and managed to catch most of the delay before landing in Brussels. Overall really nice experience but I wish they would not charge as much for seating selection before online check in. As I may be a nervous flyer I need a window seat and don't want to risk seating elsewhere. The four legs cost me more than 130 euros on pre-paid seating which I could take into account when choosing between BA and an another airline that let you choose free of charge when booking your flight. Besides that I won't hesitate to fly BA in the future.
412,Travelled LGW-MCO-LGW route in Business and was really happy. Great check at Check in at LGW then priority security access. The lounge was superb. Seats on 777ER outward were 2J and 2K which were fine but we changed to 11E and 11F for the return as we noticed that on outward these were more enclosed. Flat beds were great Service was exceptional. Both flights left on time and arrived on time. Delta lounge at MCO is a bit dated but served a purpose so cant complain. Was a bit worried about the service reading some of the reviews but was pleasantly surprised. Well done BA.
413,LHR-EZE business class on board B777. Tired old cabin old IFE system. Business class seat layout cramped and uncomfortable with forward and rear facing seats. However cabin crew deserve praise for their excellent attention.
414,Pisa-LGW. Lounge at Pisa is a shared set up and rather nice. Spacious and colourful. Comfortable seats. Much better than hanging around the terminal. We have used it a few times. Plenty of booze. Mediocre snacks. No food. Checked in online. Baggage drop off. No problems. Plane was parked on the tarmac. Had to hike across in hot sun (which made me wish I wasn't going home). This is very annoying - because the whole point over flying BA instead of the three bright white blue and yellow planes of the Irish airline's planes parked next door - is convenience. This has in the past but did not this time include the use of an air-bridge. (More BA cuts I wonder) Plane was a newish A319 - and pushed back to the minute - and left bang on time. All clean and tidy including the wash-rooms. Seats rather old and worn - but we were comfortable in seats 1 a and 1 c. Afternoon tea served on board - nothing exceptional (not a lot one can do with this sort of meal) - but as my wife was driving when we landed I happily drank three Gin and T's. FA's very pleasant and friendly. Even offered me a 4th G&T which I declined. All in all a good experience. (seats could be much better though). Landed ahead of schedule.
415,I flew from Heathrow to Istanbul on BA on their 767 the crew in Club Europe were very accommodating in their service. From start to finish of the flight they ensured that all passengers in Club Europe received the upmost service. Although the 767 is starting to show some age I prefer this version of the Club Europe seats compared to the new configuration which is being rolled out on their Airbuses. At least the seats on the 767 are comfortable & there is plenty of space between the rows compared the the new version which has the same pitch as economy. The catering was good with a great choice of meals to select from the service was speedy and accommodating too with their drinks etc..
416,Flew First from London to Seattle checked in at T5 and escorted to check-in desk and was checked in very quickly security was quick and then through the million dollar door straight into the Concorde Room. Had lunch in the lounge and think our host was just finishing her shift as not that attentive and service improved markedly when other staff took over after our starters. Good selection of food and drinks and a very relaxing start to our flight. Boarding smooth and both of us were escorted to our seats 2E/F which are 2 together in the middle of the cabin. Cabin crew on both sides were excellent and couldn't do enough to make our flight comfortable. Seat very good and food good quality with a wide selection of drinks available. Flight passed very quickly and being first off plane meant we were first at US immigration although there was no queues so through within 5 minutes and our bags were first off. Excellent flight.
417,Flight BA 677 Istanbul to London Heathrow Club Europe a great flight with a wonderful crew in Club Europe excellent service from all members of the crew with updates and a warm welcome by name from them. The meal was very good indeed with a great choice of meals to choose from. Throughout the flight the crew were very professional and quick to serve the meal and to clear away the meal items too. Although a 767 which was showing some signs of age I much prefer this aircraft with the old style Club Europe seats compared to the new Club Europe which has been rolled out by BA and which no one likes. A wonderful flight and great service what more could I ask from a great crew all that I do ask is keep the 767 & go back to the old Club Europe.
418,Manchester to JFK via Heathrow and back. Positive experience although the flight from Manchester to Heathrow was delayed (outside BA control) we were constantly informed about the delays. Attention to detail was excellent. BA upgraded our flights at our request promptly and without any fuss (Silver wedding Anniversary). The flight attendants were excellent and the food (and drinks) was tasty. Some passengers can be somewhat critical about BA but we were more then satisfied with the service.
419,Travelled from Gatwick to Barbados on Boeing 777. Seating very good. As many reviewers mention the screen is small with a limited amount of films. Overall staff very good although one member of staff forget to give bread rolls out with the dinner until asked. The same member of staff also forgot requested drinks. Very good boarding procedure and disembarkment Overall a pleasant flight.
420,BRU-LHR-DFW-SAT. BRU-LHR: Club Europe Smooth check-in with friendly ground crew small but clean lounge with a delicious croissant and coffee greeted by friendly cabin-crew who gave us an excellent service on this small flight starting with hot towels tasting hot breakfast and excellent tea seats are comfortable but narrow for this short flight. LHR-DFW: First class with fast security process Concorde room with online reserved Cabana was again an island of rest and comfort. Clean 777-300 greeted by name flight crew were excellent. Flight and service couldn't be better. Food was good amenity kit contains everything you need on a 10-hours flight slippers and pyjamas were comfortable. Service was private excellent and on request always with a smile asking if everything was alright. Screen in first is still on of the best with a good selection of movies. DFW-SAT: First class customs in Dallas were electronic for ESTA people so 10 minutes after leaving the plane I was waiting for my bags so I could recheck for my last domestic flight! Greeted by friendly crew when boarding old plane AA. We were offered hot towel and glass of champagne. Friendly captain told us after leaving the gate that there was a problem and we did have to taxi to another gate for technical support. After 1 hour (captain had kept us informed) we took off an arrived after a short flight in San Antonio.
421,This was the first time I have flown with BA and I have to say I was very impressed. I flew economy from Brisbane to LHR return. Via Singapore on the outgoing trip and Hong Kong on the return leg. The experience was so much better than on previous flights I had taken with competing airlines. The cabin felt spacious and comfortable even in economy. There was a good range of inflight entertainment and all staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The cost of the flight was a little more expensive than other airlines but having been very satisfied with the service it would not preclude me from booking with them again. Would preference them over other airlines now following that trip along with recommending them to others.
422,IST-LHR the so called business class is a joke and is virtually indistinguishable from economy on any decent airline seats are crammed together and do not recline properly there is no sort of entertainment whatsoever on a four hour flight. Having flown on Turkish Royal Jordanian Emirates and Cathay Pacific in the past couple of months only made the contrast more striking. Never again!
423,A short hop from LCY-ZRH. Nice clean Embraer which was only about 30% full on a Monday afternoon. Off on time landed early decent pasta salad meal and a white wine in flight. Smooth and efficient journey at a very good price.
424,SAT-DFW-LHR-BRU: First First club Europe. SAT-DFW: Nice and smooth check-in with friendly ground crew no lounge but used my priority pass to enter United lounge. Plane delayed for one hour. Boarding smooth greeted by friendly cabin crew captain apologised for the delay. Offered hot towels and champagne and crisps or nuts. Short but nice flight. Landed with a small delay. DFW-LHR: First class lounge in DFW is very basic and far from boarding gate. Boarding again was very smooth with waiting flight crew greeting you by name and guiding to your seat. Champagne was offered before you could take place in your seat. This first class travel was again a more than excellent flight. Also this time there was a technical issue but the captain informed us about every step excused several times for the delay again when landing in London with a delay of more than an hour. Cabin crew gives you the feeling you are the only guest on board giving you private service on demand. LHR-BRU: Club Europe. Concorde room with online reserved Cabana and a tasteful breakfast. Private bathroom with shower gave me a new revival boost. Boarding yes again excellent in all ways short flight. Hot towels decent food and perfect service by a perfect crew.
425,"LGW-Pisa. I wrote a positive experience a few weeks ago - on the LHR route to Pisa. I am pleased to write (wait for it) another positive review. This time it was the ""old"" Club Europe and better in my view. As I said before its a shame BA cannot produce something exceptional rather than ""Very Good"" when it comes to the seat. The lounge was okay - not to crowded. Flight left 10 minutes late. Very nice meal on board. Really tasty and fresh. Nice smoked salmon and so on. A few Gin and T's washed it down. Friendly FA's. Smooth flight. My only gripe we were parked off station on the outer airport - like Ryanair. A small hassle with a walk over the tarmac. Bags were not given priority which was annoying. All in all - a good experience."
426,Excellent experience LHR to HKG. Was a bit apprehensive about their reputation but found the whole trip excellent. Staff were friendly and helpful aircraft was clean and IFE gave a wide choice. Drinks offered half an hour into the flight and meal served within an hour. Would definitely travel with BA again.
427,We flew Premium Economy class from Singapore to London on a 747 carrier. It was a waste of money. The plane looked 100 years old and nothing seemed to work properly. The entertainment system remote control was stuck to its base and it had to be removed with a sharp instrument. The little screen showed a blurred picture so it was not worth watching movies. The crew was nowhere to be seen and they couldn''t be called if you needed something because the call button had been cancelled on all remote controls. At some stage I went to the toilet and went through the kitchen. The crew was there talking and laughing and one of them was sitting reading the paper. Shame on you BA. Never again!
428,LHR-SYD-LHR via Singapore. I hadn't flown BA long-haul for over fifteen years and so given some of the rather negative reviews on this site I approached the experience with trepidation. However I needn't have worried: everything was tip-top from on-line check-in bag drop lounges boarding on-time departure and arrival on both legs and prompt luggage collect. The aircraft both ways was a newish 777-300ER clean and well maintained and while the herring-bone seat configuration does seem a bit weird on both sectors I was in the last row window seat facing backwards with an empty seat next to me so I was able to slip in and out easily enough and didn't have anyone facing me. The seat was a little narrow for business class. but very comfortable with lots of storage space and no shortage of pillows and blankets; the IFE was excellent - screen on the small side but very good definition and audio. Food was simple but very good quality fresh well-presented and lots of it. Very generous with the booze - excellent champagne wines and some fine malt whiskies all served correctly by the wonderfully attentive FAs: old school British middle aged ladies and gentlemen chatty and polite to the point of parody but the twinkle in their eyes tells you that they know it. An excellent experience keep it up BA.
429,LHR-MAD with BA462 on a Boeing 767-300ER. Very full flight but it didn't stop the crew from delivering superb customer service! Drinks and sandwich offered 30 minutes after take off. Second round of drinks offered. Very cheerful crew helpful and friendly. Pilot personally came out to greet passengers on our way out. Very smooth take off. Landing could be better. Would definitely fly with British Airways again!
430,For my annual trip ATH-PHL via any European city (dep 18/3 return 19/4) this time I chose BA because they were the cheapest. This was my first flight on BA to the USA. Soon after my choice I tried to select a seat as far front as possible however I was asked to pay 35 euros for a seat in row. 27. 35 euros and you are almost at the end of the aircraft. In the end BA was more expensive than others. The flight was ok and punctual B777 not really my choice as very noisy staff service - one hostess was excellent another was ignorant and unwilling. Food the usual Penne Rigate. Complained to BA via email however no reply was ever received. For my return flight I was in row 30 same noisy B777 same Penne Rigate and of course a good choice of inflight entertainment. Breakfast with lovely frozen bread roll. Yes frozen or chilled. My next choice will of course not be BA.
431,A short haul from Gatwick to Rome and I had no expectations. Check in was quick and we were on a vintage Boeing 737. All in all very happy. They supplied a decent enough snack. Drinks service was efficient. There was no in- flight entertainment available but we should all be able to cope for 2 hours without surely? Comfortable enough friendly service got there on time and good price. All adds up to a happy traveller.
432,NCL-LHR return. Great alternative to rail travel which is sometimes more expensive. Check-in was a breeze on both sides. New comfortable A320 cabin old ones were really aged. A choice of snack and drink were served with options for alcohol. Delay arriving into Heathrow as usual the airport is really over capacity and limiting BA as an airline. Annoyed that you are no longer able to choose your seat on hand-baggage only fares!
433,Flew from London Heathrow to Rome Fiumicino. Flew the same route last year too and both times it was excellent. This time our flight was operated with an Airbus A320 with slim line seats that looked brand new. These were very comfortable for a short haul flight and the leg room sufficient. In-flight catering was excellent. Coffee was a bit weak but the sandwiches were delicious. This time cheese and ham doorstop with white bread. I expected good things after last years flat bread and was not disappointed. Cabin crew were very friendly and efficient as were the airport staff. Boarding process was fast and efficient and on both flights at arrival and destination the aircraft was at a jet bridge so no need to board a bus. Flights departed and arrived on time. Will definitely fly BA again.
434,LHR-SFO-LHR. Missed out on the A380 and both legs were in a 747-400. Planes were old but well maintained and clean so no complaints there. Outward leg was excellent with good food and great cabin service. On the return leg the lady in front fully reclined her seat immediately after take off and went to sleep leaving me with just about the same cramped space as you have in Economy. Even during meal service cabin crew did nothing to alleviate the situation. Very disappointed with this aspect and also with the breakfast. How many people on this site have complained that they do not want a hard croissant and sweet cereal bar for breakfast. BA are you listening?
435,Heathrow to Bilbao. This is one of BA's new routes (although they used to fly the route years ago on a B757) and we got our return flights for a bargain Â£74. BA's hand luggage only fares to Europe offer very good value and I wonder when they will consider this pricing tier for long haul routes! The A319 flight left from Heathrow Terminal 1 which is closing in June but now looks and feels like a ghost town. There were 3 shops open on the day of our departure and most of it is boarded up. As for the flight we had the usual BA chaotic boarding process but overall an excellent flight even if the new seats are uncomfortable and certainly similar to Ryanair with hardly any space. I appreciate BA's offering of sandwiches on their short haul flights but do wonder whether passengers really need this service nowadays.
436,Club Europe LHR-AMS. The boarding process was a joke we had to take the bus to our aircraft. In the boarding lounge they asked for all Club Europe and Gold and Silver to come forward and board the bus then they let all of the remaining passengers board the bus which made priority boarding a total joke. They should follow the same process when flights land at a remote stand and have a separate bus just for use by Club Europe passengers at least when departing Club Europe passengers would enjoy their priority boarding. I understand there is a need for on time departures but BA really need to ensure that where priority boarding is taking place their Club Passenger receive it.
437,"BA 1321 Newcastle to Heathrow 1/4/15. Check in at Newcastle was as always very fast and efficient. Once on board the cabin crew did a great job of welcoming everyone. A great crew offering old school BA charm at it's best and no small achievement considering the very early departure time. New and very ""compact"" seating which seems to be the new norm for economy class travel on short haul European flights. Flight arrived at T5 not quite on time as I remember but hey ho not at all bad."
438,Flew Gatwick to Kingston 13/3/15 return 27/3/15 big disappointment had to climb over strangers legs to leave seats. Not all options of food available if your at the end of the meal run. Need to pay to sit together separated from my husband who was next to a nice bloke who was happy to move so we could sit together BA did not even try to accommodate us. Not worth the money Virgin far superior from their lounge to the flight. Will never travel BA long haul again be warned don't waste your money.
439,BA1326 Heathrow to Newcastle 22/4/15. Checked in at T5 by an agent who should train some of the others. Very welcoming instantly struck up a conversation with me this person was a credit to the company and a much needed one. The good experience ended there. Punctuality reared it's ugly head once more. I've recorded this repeatedly. Departure was delayed 45 minutes. Not the end of the world but an inconvenience which happens so regularly I can pretty much count on it. It's a shame BA can't address these issues and get flights operating to schedule the majority of the time as other airlines are well able to. Once on board BA is like a tale of two airlines. Some crews are excellent others just lack professionalism and behave rather strangely at times. Possibly this may stem from the two tier or mixed fleet system. But whatever the issue may be crew quality and service is inconsistent. When we landed at Newcastle a crew member announced that the flight was only 30 minutes behind schedule! Well marvellous not in my opinion. Having just flown around the world on another airline which was able to operate twelve out of thirteen flights either on time or ahead of schedule I have to say that I remain generally unimpressed.
440,Hong Kong to London in World. It was on the A380 - first time aboard and must say I was impressed. A much better experience than the Emirates A380. Great mood lighting large windows. Nice to have a number of small cabins on both decks. Friendly service from the crew.
441,April 3 2015 Sydney-LHR. Staff were quite attentive and pleasant throughout both sectors. The cabin looked very new was clean and comfortable. IFE was fine although not as good as CX. I was sitting in window seat facing backwards which was fine. The seat while sitting is comfortable enough although quite narrow. There is little storage and it can be awkward getting in and out of the seat especially when you are on the window. The problem was when the seat was in flat-bed mode. It is so narrow that you cannot turn. The seat buckles in the middle. As well the passenger next to me would slam his table and TV monitor shut throughout the flight and because of the design the seat you feel every movement. To get comfortable I had to put the seat in more of a recline mode in order to sleep which defeats the whole purpose of a flat bed. As well a fold down footstool completes the end of the bed and it wasn't stable. BA are charging a premium for this seat and they squeeze 8 across (compared to 4 for CX). They are making a great deal out of this amount of real estate in the air. It is time for them to deliver an update. The only reason I took this fare was because of the great luggage offering (which I needed on this occasion - 96 kg) and the fact that I was flying back in First for no additional cost which I will post about separately. So while I recommend this airline overall it is more because the service and staff did compensate. Next time I fly business it will be CX again. The seat is a real let down.
442,15th Aug 2014 flight BA0272. Me and my 3 friends flew from SAN to LHR then to IST. Our check in and baggage processes took almost 2 hours to be completed. I wonder what would happen if we were not been there 5 hours before our flight. When they gave us our tickets we saw that they put us all separately. They could not even manage to sit us together. When I was thinking how could this get worse we missed our LHR-IST flight and waited in a queue for 3 hours to go to our hotel. While a clerk was trying to complete our check-in for 2 hours another clerk next to her managed to complete half of the passengers processes and when we were boarding the plane we learnt that the plane was overbooked and the other cl erk was offering 800 dollars per person and free accommodation for volunteer passengers to fly on the next plane.
443,April 15 LHR-Sydney (via Singapore). I flew First as part of a promotion for no additional cost with purchase of business seat on SYD-LHR leg. I really enjoyed the Concorde Room at Terminal 5 lovely meal great service and very elegant space. In terms of the flight the FA were very friendly and helpful on all legs. They went out of their way to make you feel special and a guest. Food was very good as was wine offering. Seat was comfortable and roomy although there is a lot less storage then in CX Business Seat. In fact while there is a lot of room much of it really is not that useful. At night FA did disappear for much of the time and didn't really come around (except once) to offer water/juice. Whereas on SQ economy FA would check on you regularly throughout flight. While of course it is very special to fly First next time I would be just as happy to fly CX Business which I think is really great value for money and the seats are just as or maybe even more comfortable. If I had paid full fare for this flight I think I would have been questioning the value for money.
444,BA662 31st March. BA662 14th April. BA makes us think 'better quality'. However the flight to and from Cyprus is now disappointing in terms of food offered. The duration is over 4 hours and it is not acceptable for them to offer 2 cold sandwiches.
445,BA 730 LHR-GVA 20 Apr 15. Are fooling no-one with their new Club Europe Business Class seats - they look nice - but are too close together providing extremely poor legroom! As a regular London to Geneva traveller I will go back to flying Swiss! The decision to change this is almost as bad as the stupid decision to have seats facing backwards in Club World where you have to face strangers and climb over others to get to your seat. If you can't fly First Class with BA choose another airline until they remedy these issues because their Business Class product is rubbish!
446,BA0010 World Traveller 4 Apr 2015. Bangkok-Heathrow (London). BA0009 World Traveller 17 Apr 2015 Heathrow (London) - Bangkok. The check in staff were unhelpful and refused to check my luggage through despite it being done on the first leg of my trip I also met others on the same flight where this was allowed. The plane was old. The Cabin crew were professional however compared to the middle eastern airlines the service wasnt nearly as good.
447,LHR-BKK in Club on B777. Fourth long haul leg on BA in the last month and this was by far the best flight. That said I still think the product is disappointing. I'm the camp that says the seats are highly uncomfortable. They are far too narrow as an average sized person still finds their arms draped across the arm rests while trying to sleep. You simply can't keep your arms by your side. As such little to no sleep. IFE outdated and awful.
448,LHR-AMS-LHR in Club Europe on A321. Nice service for a short hop. I think BA's Club Europe product is better than their long haul product. No flat beds but aircraft were in good condition cabin crews professional efficient and genuinely nice. Food was actually edible with a cheese and charcuterie plate. Both flights delayed due to Heathrow congestion and Amsterdam weather but other than that a pretty good experience.
449,"LHR-PHL BA067 19th April. One of the features of a British Airways (BA) flight that attracted me in the past was the breadth of special-meal options. This until recently included a ""seafood meal"". Indeed ten years ago BA had fisherman's pie as an option in economy class not just the horrible and relentless chicken-or-pasta - then they boasted of their support for the British fishing industry - no longer. Seafood meals are gone. Why? From a BA response: ""I'd like to inform you that the meals have been removed due to the low volumes with many of our customers now choosing other options"". Indeed. If no seafood meal exists then there is no choice there are no options. There is only chicken-or-pasta. Really what would it take to offer a ""cold seafood meal"" a tuna-fish salad and a bread roll? One more reason to choose BA is gone. One more reason to fly with a Middle Eastern airline such as Etihad who still care about service of a sort that BA has started to abandon."
450,Flew BA1385/175 MAN-JFK. First flight full but smooth second flight on old but clean 747 with good leg room. Wifi and food good. Was just thinking as we were landing early what a good flight it had been when landing was aborted abruptly and we circled again eventually the captain said that two warning lights had gone off but the problem appeared to be rectified his manner remained calm and the plane landed safely me and several around me were obviously very anxious.
451,17 April 2015 Airbus A320 Business Heathrow to Lisbon. A total waste of money. The food was horrible. A couple of sandwiches and a lousy bread served with jam. There was no entertainment system and the only difference I could find from economy was that the middle seat was empty and a portable table was placed between the arm rests. The seat pitch was pathetic and could not even get a rest. I am very disappointed that I did not choose TAP instead of British.
452,LHR to SYD on 1/3/15 and ACK to LHR on 14/3/15. After some poor reviews I was a little worries as to the quality and whether premium economy would be worth the extra cost. I have previously travelled down under with Cathay and Malaysian and wondered how BA would measure up. I was pleasantly surprised. Cabin on both planes was clean staff mostly attentive (Hong Kong leg to Heathrow staff were worst of the 4 legs - ok but didn't seem overly interested in going the extra mile). As a taller person I appreciated the additional legroom and recline although when passenger in front reclined it is tricky to get out of your seat. I had veggie meals which were generally tasty and as usual served prior to everyone else - i did have to remind staff on the last leg to offer me a drink when they served everyone else's meal. Film selection was excellent - travelling shortly after Oscar season meant most of the big nominated films were available! I will definitely pay for PE again on long-haul.
453,My experience on return BA flights to LHR to Tokyo Narita in April 2015 scores very low. I used to fly on Virgin Atlantic for the same journey on Business Class for the past 10 years so I have something to compare and the fare is always more or less the same between those 2 airlines. Conclusion is that you get far better value and service for money for the Business Class on Virgin was my impression. BA T5 lounge is very photogenic but the reality is quite 'basic' and cheap decor. Selection of food and beverages is limited. In the end I got fed up so I left the lounge to get better food from Wetherspoons! Since I'm small both airlines seats are fine to get a good sleep. On BA you'd still have to pay to select your seat despite paying thousands of pounds! Also if you are in the middle aisle on BA you are right next to a stranger which is awkward. BA gives out Elemis kits. Food: on BA there is a 'fixed' options. For the dessert you have to choose either 'cake' or 'cheese'. Not both. Also not too different a menu from Economy class. BA's service felt extremely limited they don't know your names they just do the very minimum service. BA disappointed me.
454,My return flight from Heathrow to Bologna last week reminded me of how good BA is for short haul in economy. Even a two-hour delay because of technical problems on the outgoing flight did nothing to change that view. The pilot kept us up to date on what was happening. The crew were charming. OK the snack of a sandwich on such flights is pretty basic but the whole experience is so much more civilized than on budget airlines.
455,Gatwick to Thessaloniki return. Outbound ok not fantastic but certainly not bad. However where BA scored was on the return. At check-in the clerk was all prepared for my wife and I even though we were on separate bookings including ready printed lounge passes with my guest pass stapled to her own. Maybe a little thing but it made a difference.
456,DEL-LHR BA 256. Seats 17AB downstairs in business class in B747-400 G-BNLY. The aircraft is an old lady now but the interior is well maintained. Her age was most noticeable looking at the in-flight screen. I have become used to the clarity of modern screens and the faded dim and blurred old fashioned moving map and flight information screens are a relic of a distant past. I have made several long haul flights with BA in Business Class recently and have decided that I don't like the standard BA model business class seat. There is nowhere to put small items like glasses pens landing cards and so on. There is a drawer at floor level suitable for shoes and other items you will not want during the flight but to access it you need an upright seat and have to sit well forward to lean down to it. There is no foot rest integrated into the seat one you can adjust to your own preferred level. At the front of the seat pod is a flap then can be lowered by getting out of the seat. It is not strong and so can not be used as a seat and is not an ottoman. Clunky and peculiar to BA it is not a design feature that enhances the seat. Individual seats feel narrow and the window seat pod facing aft is accessed through a narrow entrance leading into a snug and very private space. Thoughts about coffins come to mind. When the passenger in the row behind has their seat flat their feet cross the entrance to yours and have to be stepped over to exit. Seat 17B was a poor choice. It is just aft of a set of catering cupboards that are frequently accessed during meal service and a washroom that seems to be in use almost continuously with queues stretching past the seat after meals and before landing. On the good side the seats are well contoured and comfortably padded.
457,"10 April 2015 Airbus A320 Business Heathrow to Rome FCO. A total waste of money. The food was ""tea"" there was no entertainment system and the only difference I could find from premium coach or regular coach was that the middle seat was empty and a portable table was placed between the arm rests. As alcoholic beverages are provided for all classes there's nothing to be gained there the seat pitch was pathetic and aside from having the middle seat empty the only benefit to be had was boarding and de-planing first. Don't waste your money unless someone else is paying for it."
458,Flew BA256 from Delhi to Heathrow - usual BA issues which have been repeated here many times. Firstly the First cabin was not clean (at all) with debris on the floor food still in the seat - it's pretty pathetic when you have to spend 5 minutes cleaning your area when you board! The food - the food can only be described as truly awful! To be honest I would be complaining if I received this standard of food in economy - the starter was a watery oily leek and potato soup and for the main two small lamb chops overdone in gravy with 6 tiny potatoes that deflated when pierced with a fork. I did not bother with desert! Afternoon tea served up (probably) the worst patisserie I have ever had the displeasure of tasting - completely inedible. The cabin crew were good and pleasant however I was not offered any bottled water for a 10 hour flight. It would seem to me that BA are a budget airline trying to do luxury and failing horribly. Surely management cannot be happy with their current standards but I am struggling to see any level of improvement (I take at least 1 first class international flight every year). Have flown BA for 15 years will now be trying other airlines. The lounge (not run by BA but used by BA) at Delhi was very good indeed.
459,9 April 2015 BA 777 Business Class Seattle USA - Heathrow. Check-in easy lounge good boarding pleasant. Food quality was good not excellent but the film choice was great. Flat bed seats were comfortable enough. The breakfast was a little skimpy. The major downside was that for the money you pay for business class you should not have to pay to choose a seat at booking. BA will let you choose seats 7 days in advance if you are a mileage plan 1st elevated tier or better member but if not then you have to wait until 24 hours ahead. Of course you can always fork over another $113 to pre-reserve a seat. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you.
460,We flew for the very first time on BA on 27/03/15 and returned 06/03/15. Our holiday to St Lucia from Gatwick was booked through Kuoni and we usually fly with Virgin Atlantic. We always upgrade with Virgin to Premium Economy as you have a larger luggage allowance and the Premium Economy Experience with Virgin is very good. Therefore we booked BA World Traveller Plus expecting the same degree of service. What a disappointment! I would not advise wasting your upgrade money. Apart from getting the larger luggage allowance BA World Traveller Plus is almost exactly the same as World Traveller. The Service both ways was appalling! The seats were old and shabby and uncomfortable we were only offered bar service once on a 8/9 Hour flight! We had to drink from plastic beakers the staff seemed preoccupied with Business Class Customers and had no time for our section at all. On the way back my Husband and myself were given seats 2 rows apart at check in without being told. We only noticed when we boarded the aircraft. On this length of flight I was most upset we were apart as everyone sat near me were single travellers and Were asleep throughout the 9 hours. The seat back TVs are very small and my TV didn't work properly and I couldn't even watch anything. The aircraft was badly in need of an interior upgrade. We will never fly with BA again anywhere and will not recommend the experience to anyone.
461,Substandard food in Business Class (London to Mauritius) arbitrary upgrade policy - as we could not afford Bus Class on return flight booked Premium Economy we told that because we were Bus on way out we would get priority consideration on way back. Charging for Seat selection is a rip off was separated from my wife on way out!
462,While I booked with BA I at first did not realise that they were putting me on a Vueling Airline but flying under a BA number. Quite clearly this airline is at the bottom of the bucket airlines in both service and comfort. As we were flying back from Barcelona to the UK having my knees wedged up against the seat in front only lasted a couple of hours. The food service which you had to pay for was indifferent and very expensive. If you sat in the middle of the plane you just didn't get served. Probably the most worrying thing besides the extremely poor English by cabin and flight crew was the cabin staff apparent indifference to seats being up right for landing preventing some passengers taking their over head luggage down while in the air and on landing passengers up and around while the aircraft was moving. Perhaps UK bucket airlines are not so bad.
463,BA 208 MIA-LHR in Club. Leg four of a seven leg BA adventure. Another disappointment which is becoming commonplace. As in leg one BKK-LHR my pre-assigned business class seat that I had selected months before departure mysteriously vanished at the gate. In the end BA needed the seat for a family to be seated together. All well and good mind you but to have the audacity to charge passengers for these seats and give them away is absolutely disgraceful. As such my quiet no traffic window seat on the upper deck was quickly relegated to a high traffic aisle seat on the main deck right near the lavatory and galley ensuring no sleep on the overnight flight. As a loyal OneWorld Emerald passenger I can honestly say BA really don't care about us in this (or any) regard. The CSD was sympathetic and kind but nobody else seemed to care one bit. That hasn't happened to me on any other carrier for years and has happened twice in the past few weeks on BA. Moral of the story: Never ever pay BA for a pre-assigned seat as there is simply no guarantee you will get what you pay for. Moral of the story part 2: fly another carrier if you can as it can't be much worse than BA.
464,British Airways could not care less when they knew our flight from Leeds to Heathrow had been diverted. Some queued two hours for another flight with two children only to be told we had to go to Heathrow by coach with no toilet. We had nothing to eat at the airport as no one knew what was happening. We finally got to Heathrow to be put up in a hotel and have a meal so we could fly to Miami the next day. It was a total farce at Leeds we lost a days holiday and with two children there was no consideration for them at all. We await our homeward journey on Monday and hopefully it will be a better trip back.
465,Travelled by Airbus 319 to Lyon and back to Heathrow. The new layout is very cramped. By reducing the legroom in Club Europe and removing one of the toilets at the rear they have crammed in 11 more seats. Seats 25A and B have no window as they are placed where the toilet used to be. They are adjacent to the door of the one remaining toilet. Not very pleasant. Expect long queues to use this one remaining lavatory. They also seem to have done away with the cooked breakfast on all European flights that start before 9.30am.
466,LGW to LAS had a great trip out on 2/4/15 good food IFE was fine for the daytime trip wine was flowing. Trip made even better by an upgrade to PE on return journey staff found out my partner and I got engaged couldn't have been nicer. Everything great apart from the final leg to DUB Gatwick didn't send our bags (even though we had a 6 hour layover) then preceded to keep us hanging in DUB for another 5 hours on the promise that they were on the next flight and the next ground staff of Aer Lingus were great too would fly all again.
467,LHR-FRA in Club Europe. First part is not really a review more a rant. I travel a lot for work and always try to fly BA whenever possible and so am lucky enough to have a Gold card So for our annual vacation I was looking forward to hopefully getting us all (wife plus 9 year old daughter) into the First Class lounge at LHR as a nice start to our holidays sadly the staff member on the door said no. - yes I know you can only normally sign in 1 guest but for my other 50+ flights a year I never sign in anyone! Still no joy-computer said no. So I asked the guy behind me if he would mind signing my wife into the lounge at which pointthe staff member told him quite aggressively 'that is not protocol'. We walked away having been made to feel like naughty kids. Rest of the trip was fine-In fact I would go as far as to say the flight was excellent-really friendly cabin crew who made us feel welcome and gave us a good start to the holidays. Actually I would say this was BA at its best (having just seen them at their worst!). Score given here reflect the good service in the air (would give almost full marks if not for the ground staff behaviour).
468,Travelled MAN-LHR-ATL and back. Boarding at MAN chaotic with queue in a corridor (probably not BA's fault). Delayed departure from LHR on a very full 777-200. Food and wine good but the Club World cabin is very cramped with very little space to put anything. I don't mind the back and front seating (I could look at my wife!) but the seat is narrow and not the most comfortable for sleeping. Very good attentive crew. Wide variety of films/music on IFE. On return the third party Lounge (Club at ATL) is much better than the Delta one. Full flight very similar to outbound but slightly early arrival at LHR was negated by the domestic flight being delayed by 90 minutes due to runway problems.
469,"BA0676 IST-LHR Boeing 767. Euro Traveller cabin. Read the reviews and we pre booked exit row seats 27A/B excellent choices. Leg room superb I'm 1.90m (6'3"") tall and could stretch right out with a window too. Still an old 767 though with no personal entertainment or power. Appeared to have the newer seats which were OK surprisingly the four hour flight passed quite quickly. Food was actually very good and the crew superb. Disappointing choice of alcohol though no JD or Rum. Departed IST about twenty minutes late but were only ten minutes late into LHR. Well done BA better than the outward experience reviewed earlier."
470,LGW-SZG in business class. Not sure what the point is with the new reduced legroom Club Europe seats. OK breakfast but was able to get breakfast in the lounge beforehand anyway. Only reason for going CE was because only £30 more than flexible economy ticket. If there was a big difference I wouldn't bother. Flight was on time.
471,Flew to Bangkok from London Heathrow on 13th March. First time I have ever flown with BA normally fly long haul with Virgin but they don't fly to Bangkok. We were offered upgrades in the last few days for big discount but only on the flight out. World traveller plus was very good with fab leg room and comfy seats. Nice food too. Managed to sleep 5 hours in quiet cabin. But if I had paid normal price then it was not worth the extra money as we found economy seats on the flight home were very comfy and good leg room. The plane was older 777 but not problem. very clean and the staff were attentive. I was nervous because of previous reviews but no need to be as we had a very enjoyable flight.
472,LHR-JFK/IAD-LHR. Superb round trip (for a very fair price) in economy with BA. Flight out was an hour or so late taking off because of the weather but was excellent once we got going. Fairly creaky 747 but the IFE was fine (good film selection) and the free booze flowed throughout. Great curry on the food front. Return was the real highlight on a new A380 that had joined the fleet four weeks ago. Large TVs even bigger selection of films/TV shows/games and the usual good free food (shepherd's pie) and drink (red wine and beer). Comfy seats with plenty of leg room (and I'm over six foot). Service on both flights exemplary and I have to say that I think BA have become a really class act.
473,Flew 30th March 2015 LHR-YVR return with my school on a rugby tour (27 people). Seats were reasonably comfortable and they catered to my food requests of no pork well. Enjoyed it. But the IFE was absolutely horrendous and did not meet my expectations of British Airways- outdated movies with TV shows from 3 months before. Since we were flying on a Boeing 747-400 there were more seats per aisle but this made the cabin feel quite cramped. One recommendation for them - put fewer seats per aisle! Even though there were negatives flying outbound I have to say the return was great. I had swapped seats with another boy who wanted to sit next to someone so I sat in the extra legroom seats. IFE was far better and due to having the window seat I was able to sleep for around 6 hours when I was awoke by the breakfast/snack which was decent. Food had no flavour and was quite spicy (Lentil masala) but still edible. Although my experience on BA84 was very enjoyable I heard many of my companions had to move seats because of the not working IFE. One of my coaches had ordered orange juice so the cabin crew gave it to him as they were serving but then the other one would take it away for some reason and in the end they said they had none left. He had flown with Cathay Pacific to Manila the preceding week and he said that he had enjoyed that thoroughly. One of his worst experiences of air travel especially due to him being 6'4 and rather large. Overall a decent experience but just met my expectations. To improve British Airways need to start to be able to compete with other airlines like Singapore Emirates Etihad Cathay Pacific and Qantas as there service and level of comfort has definitely taken over from BA.
474,Heathrow to Istanbul flight BA0676 in club class. I should have guessed what I was going to get when I saw this service is operated on a Boeing 767. Business or club class is a total waste of money same seat as in economy. No extra leg room or width no individual inflight entertainment and no seat power it's horrendous you may just as well book euro traveller. Both seats had seen better days the covers of which were in places falling apart. Food was only average too in my opinion. On the plus side of things the plane was for its age (it was the oldest 767 BA has got) in surprisingly good order and the staff were friendly enough and the flight arrived only ten minutes late which is a result.
475,LHR to Philadelphia but return from JFK. Booked Club World and upgraded to First with Avios. Great service as always in First and the Concorde room continues to excel.
476,I travelled from London to Jo'burg and back on the Airbus 380 and had mixed experiences. On the way out I was in Premium Economy and was pleasantly surprised by the spacious seat and window locker and slept well. The return in Business was a different matter. I was truly shocked by how many seats had been crammed in the uncomfortable narrow seat the lack of privacy and having to climb over passenger's feet to vacate my seat. All this at a premium price. Shocking. The cabin crew were faultless and were only too aware of passengers' views on the cabin! Never again.
477,From Shanghai to London on 17 Mar. The whole trip was very good. The check in procedure was very quick. Boarding was finished very quickly. The cabin staff were helpful and friendly. The cabin was very quiet. The temperature was very appropriate. I did enjoy the flight. Meal was tasty drinks were quite good .Luggage was not lost. I really can not expect more.
478,Flew Warsaw to Heathrow. Reasonable all round. Fairly nice sandwich and drinks. Crew were patient with some passengers who thought they were in an all inclusive hotel. Very busy flight. New seats are extremely cramped. Feels a bit Ryanair. Boarding a bit chaotic as didn't do by seat row. Baggage started coming off one carousel at Heathrow only to inexplicably move to a different one without warning or announcement.
479,Booked a trip via American Airlines and my flight from London to Seattle was on BA. What a treat. I wish all my AA trips were done by BA. Great service leg space beautiful gates airplanes. The 8.5 hr trip went by quickly. TV in every seat with plenty of great choices. Food was good and flight attendants were helpful and patient.
480,London Heathrow to Dubai return. This is a fairly regular trip for leisure purposes. Bought a PE ticket and used Avios to upgrade as is my usual habit. Prefer overnight flights but these recent ones were daylight. To be honest I only really choose Biz for the space and flatbed. I do always find the food to be good though. It was a 747 going and a 777 coming back. I find the BA service to only be average and functional. I was 'missed' for several things and gave up trying to find anyone for a cup of tea. Other airlines give a better service and provide a better product but so long as I upgrade with points and I can get a window seat I shall stick with it.
481,Return LHR-YVR Boeing 747-400. I had been advised to fly BA but unfortunately I ended up very disappointed with the return leg. My seat was double booked so they eventually got me one but the entertainment system was not working! When I asked about it she said it had not been working yesterday either. No other vacant seats in economy but there were loads in business class but would not upgrade me. 10hr flight with nothing. Definitely would not fly with them again.
482,I usually have very positive experiences when flying BA. This time travelling on 30/03/15 LCA-LGW the staff could not have been any less interested in the comfort of the passengers. It was a 4.5 hour flight and were served the meal within the first 20minutes with nothing to do for the next 4 hours. There was no inflight entertainment. The staff did not offer any hot drinks and when I walked all the way to the end of the aircraft to ask about a hot drink was told no one was going round offering tea but if I wanted one I could go and get it from service area. The staff couldn't have looked any more disinterested in their passengers!
483,LGW-JER-LGW day trip on March 25 both flights in Economy morning flight on Airbus 319 evening flight back on a 737-400 still featuring the more comfortable old seats. Both flights on-time or early. Excellent service for this short domestic hop. A breakfast sandwich and drinks were served in the morning while crisps or biscuits and full bar service were offered on the evening flight back. FAs were excellent on both legs providing a good efficient and friendly service on these short flights. Flying with hand baggage only we used web check-in for both legs which worked efficiently. Boarding procedures were unremarkable which is good. BAs Terraces Lounge in LGW is fairly comfortable and spacious enough although very busy in the morning. Acceptable cold breakfast choices and porridge as the only hot alternative. Drink choices were plentiful and of good quality. BAs Terraces Lounge in JER was more basic but again comfortable. Again various good quality drink alternatives but just very limited food options (basic snacks such as crisps and hot soup). Overall an excellent domestic flight experience for Economy. Would be more than happy to do it again. (Oneworld Sapphire).
484,VIE-LHR on March 24 and return LHR-VIE on March 30 both straight forward point to point midday flights both flights in Economy on an Airbus A320 with a mixed fleet crew both legs on-time or early.– An edible sandwich and drinks (full bar) were served on both legs. On the flight to London FAs were not unpleasant but not overly active except for the required meal service and duty free sales. However additional drinks were handed out in the galley if requested. On the flight back a rather young crew was trying harder but was - quite untypically for BA - rather robotic in their actions and announcements. Again additional drinks were served if requested. Both legs featured the new slim seats in the cabin with reduced legroom. I am really missing the older more comfortable BA seats. Flying with hand baggage only we used web check-in for the first flight and the check in kiosk for the flight back. Both worked efficiently. Boarding procedures were unremarkable and pleasant. BA uses a shared lounge in VIE which again was quite busy but not overcrowded. The Lounge as such is acceptable but far from great with limited and lower quality offerings. Food and drink seem to be more or less the same in all lounges in VIE including OS flagship lounge. BA’s Galleries Lounge in LHR T3 again a comfortable oasis of rest amid a busy airport. However this time (breakfast time) the food offerings were quite basic and drink wise even basics such as orange juice or tomato juice were not available. Hopefully just an off day. BA still uses T3 for its flights to VIE which I consider a huge benefit over using T5 which looks nice but tends to be a mess for passengers. Overall a good flight experience although I have had much better crews on BA before. Still consider BA as one of the best options for Economy flights in Europe. (Oneworld Sapphire).
485,Flew LHR-IAD-LHR on new A380's in new World Traveller Plus. Overall great service and experience with hard working and friendly crews both ways. New WTP product is great. Seats are a huge improvement although 6 hours really is the limit on the overnight leg coming home for comfort. Food was good including my partners Vegan meal. New IFE excellent and really like the upgraded noise cancelling headphones. Only 'extra' I would have liked would have been the option of a sparkling water or even wine as a pre take off drink. Have had the best and worst of BA over the years but this was definitely BA as it should be.
486,LHR-DEL rtn. B747 both ways and definitely showing their age. Crew were excellent both ways. People may not like the yin/yang seating arrangement but it doesn't bother me. The screen goes up after takeoff and you are in your own space. Seat is still very comfortable. Wine list also good and especially the Rose offer alongside the champagne.
487,"Very disappointing experience. Arrived at airport for a flight to Nice and learnt it was 1.5 hours late - with arriving aircraft nowhere in sight. Prior flight was boarding (also delayed) Having no luggage checked and seats available I thought I might get to Nice after all in time. No such luck. Whilst the flight continued to board for another 15 minutes I spent arguing with BA staff to even check whether they could get me on the flight. First class lounge staff refused to call the gate. All with ""flight is finalized"". In similar situations with other airlines (most notably Lufthansa) they always re-opened the flight and got me on. The only excuse was ""it's the rules"" (obviously BA). Staff in addition took calls whilst handling my - urgent - request further delaying the process. If I have a choice I will definitely use other airlines. In addition they have changed the seating in Europe to come more in line with Easyjet and Ryanair. At 6""4 very uncomfortable. Doesn't help to upgrade to Business: SAME seat. So you end up paying 300 pounds for a very predictable and unexciting food."
488,BRU-EWR via LHR and JFK-BRU via LHR on the return. All flights more or less on schedule. Terminal 5 in LHR is nice with a lot of sunlight making it very bright and airy looking. Cabin crew on all flights in general professional and giving a good service. Food and drinks ok. The seats are however very small and BA really needs to update their seating as soon as possible. The first flight from Brussels to London Heathrow had their updated European cabin which offers better seats but a bit less legroom. Seating on the B747 is very old but still a bit more comfortable then the new B787 Dreamliner where the seats in economy are really too small and legroom just ok.
489,23/3/2015 LHR-SIN BA011 First. Awful from booking to completion of the flight. As a BA. Gold executive member at time of booking some 11 months ago booked this flight on the new A380 only to be told by BA in May 2014 the equipment had been changed to the extremely old 744 due to technical issues. Sold feeling a little let down secured seats 1a and 2a on the 744 these are the best of a bad bunch as to I wonder why BA squeezes 14 seats into such a small area where other airlines only fit 8 seats into the front sections of 744s'. At the beginning of March I checked the booking online only to find that we had been moved to row 5 in the middle this was not acceptable. I called the BA gold line to object only to be given numerous contradicting excuses non of which were valid whilst on the flight I found out that the passenger in 1a was a lifetime gold member so. I can only assume that rank has its privileges. Now onto the flight arrogant staff with one exception really poor food served at different times as we were in the middle which meant we had different staff attending to us. Plane interior shabby not surprised for a 20 plus year old plane along with the PA being inaudible I felt this to be a safety issue and when mentioned I was ignored. I booked this flight for us a part of a special Far East holiday I had high expectations of BA First which have not been met in anyway what a total waste of money. Will now try to avoid flying BA in any of there classes once I have redeemed my Avios balance.
490,LHR-PHL return. First only half full on both legs as Club not oversold. Very much better service than when full as crew have time to interact. BA really should consider cutting back the number of seats and sell a truly premium product like so many others have now chosen to do. Food disappointing as usual - much room for improvement here. Decent wines but whites/champagne always warm on the return as kept unchilled during the turnaround. T5 experience fine both ways as mid-week and time of year not so busy. Lounges good and lounge staff friendly both LHR and PHL.
491,This was the last flight in a One World around the world ticket. Buenos Aries to LHR a 13 hour flight. I really didn't have any complaints about this flight or BA but against the other 7 airlines in 3 months it was pretty average. The FA's were helpful the food was OK the only really bad thing was the AVOD. Half a dozen new releases and a dozen or so older films. Likewise the album selection- pretty poor. The 777 was around 6 years old so maybe was due for an upgrade. To be fare I'm comparing BA against Emirates so no contest really!
492,London Gatwick (LGW) to Lanzarote (ACE). We haven't flown BA for sometime and to be honest we have no desire to fly with BA again anytime soon. The plane was an Airbus 320 and was just like a bus. Uncomfortable hard very upright seats not even sure you can recline them. We sat in row 11 and on both outward and inbound flights the cabin temperature was far to hot and stuffy although it seemed to be an issue in just 4 rows as the front and back of the plane was much cooler. We both came off the return flight with bad headaches. The food was simply awful thank goodness we ate a proper breakfast before boarding as the minuscule roll and wrap was hardly enough to feed a child and on that topic the food was not suitable for a young toddler and there was no child option. The service was ok nothing to complain about very matter of fact and despite the previous comments the plane was clean etc. We flew the same route in October last year with a UK holiday airline and that was all round far more superior.
493,DEL-LHR-HAM in Business. The club world product feels really old now. The seats are narrow and not up to the standards of a world class airline. It was innovative when it came out but now feels narrow dated and not a match even to Air India which has modern flat seats on the Dreamliner. The food was OK but nothing special. The service was also ok but lacked touches like smiles hot towels. Amenity kits very cheap. The young Indian crew members on the Delhi route noticeably better than the older London based British crew. The plane was an old and slightly grubby 747. Basically everything was mediocre if adequate. The overall impression was a product past it's prime from the 1990s. Old planes old crew old seats old IFE BA are losing ground not just to Emirates but also other European carriers like LH or AF. It feels like the 1970s and 1980s before BA transformed itself.
494,Day to trip to Hamburg booked the day before travel. Great value for money. Outbound flight was on refurbished A320. Great new cabin comfortable seats - with enough legroom and great new lighting. On return was another A320 class - not refurbished. Definitely will be good once all are refitted.
495,I flew today from San Francisco to Heathrow Business Class and as always it's a delight flying with BA. Staff were helpful and polite - in fact they couldn't do enough for me. Seats were comfortable. Entertainment was OK and food was satisfactory. My only criticism is that on the outbound flight we were served lunch immediately on taking off but then had to wait neatly 7 hours for a light snack before landing. As I did not want to 'raid the larder' and eat fattening foods I was left starving! I still find the overall experience with BA is far superior to any other airline.
496,We flew from LHR to Brussels and back on a reward flight which was very pleasant even though it was a quick hop across the channel! Just about had time to enjoy the cream tea on the outbound flight. Quality of the tea drink was the best I've tasted in the sky. The champagne was very nice too. Business lounge at Brussels was very pleasant and is to be recommended.
497,GRU-LHR 15 March 2015. Returned to BA this last 3 flights solely due to Avios companion coupon but purchased this tkt. Bossy cabin crew in the like of BA as we remember its glory days. G&T always welcome but skimpy and only one and no nibbles! Wine was good this flight. South America routes still dogged with ageing 747 as opposed to Lufthansa's modern or upgraded fleet. Outbound from LHR my TV didn't work but they did credit me 3000 avios. Food okay but snacks for such a long flight poor. KLM and AF do it better.
498,GVA-LGW-GVA A319 out and A320 in. On time in both directions staff were professional and polite. Sandwich out and a choice of snacks (crisps biscuits or chocolate raisins) in as well as complementary drinks including alcohol. Smooth through Geneva airport in and out; stuck in a 40-minute passport queue at LGW on the way in (not BA's fault of course) followed by a long walk around renovation work for the airport shuttle to the train station. This was a rare occasion where BA was cheaper than all of the competition on the route. On balance I just don't think the BA experience is much better than the low-cost competition unless you fly to Heathrow where Terminal 5 is much nicer than Gatwick. Although the food and drink is free the choice is quite limited (e.g. no British beer no option to buy something substantial if you're hungry and the snack was a bit stingy on the way back). I thought we might get newspapers but we didn't. On balance it was perfectly fine but I wouldn't pay the extra for BA - I'd actually rather have the choice friendliness and flexibility you get with easyJet.
499,"I have been a longstanding BA gold card holder and frequent business traveller. BA has now replaced all business class seats on short haul flights with seats so cramped that at 6'4"" I could not sit without great discomfort. This shows complete contempt for BA's customers. I first encountered this on a round trip to Brussels. It will be Eurostar for me in the future and Air France for which I also gave a gold card on other short hauls. Is the management so confident of its customer base that it can give us less space than Easyjet offers?"
500,GVA-LGW-GVA A319 out and A320 in. On time in both directions staff were professional and polite. Sandwich out and a choice of snacks (crisps biscuits or chocolate raisins) in as well as complementary drinks including alcohol. Smooth through Geneva airport in and out; stuck in a 40-minute passport queue at LGW on the way in (not BA's fault of course) followed by a long walk around renovation work for the airport shuttle to the train station. This was a rare occasion where BA was cheaper than all of the competition on the route. On balance I just don't think the BA experience is much better than the low-cost competition unless you fly to Heathrow where Terminal 5 is much nicer than Gatwick. Although the food and drink is free the choice is quite limited (e.g. no British beer no option to buy something substantial if you're hungry and the snack was a bit stingy on the way back). I thought we might get newspapers but we didn't. On balance it was perfectly fine but I wouldn't pay the extra for BA - I'd actually rather have the choice friendliness and flexibility you get with easyJet.
501,"Having heard so many negative reviews of BA I still mustered the courage to book to trip to Chicago and SFO. To begin with when I reached Mumbai airport with our online check in printouts 4 hours before scheduled departure I was pleasantly surprised to see the BA staff ready to check in the baggage. We were thru checked in up to Chicago with a 5 hour halt at LHR. London Heathrow Terminal 5 is chaotic to say the least the security taking forever (in our case 45 min) to clear the hand baggage gave us some 3 hours before we boarded our Chicago flight which was comfortable. Our next connection from Chicago to SFO on AA was a bit messy as the cabin space was full and last minute check-in of hand baggage was enforced. Then for our SFO-LHR-DEL flight the SFO-LHR got delayed but again check-in was pleasant and though the connection time between two flights was 80 minutes because of the delay we had a margin of only 35 minutes. When we requested the flight purser to let us disembark before anyone else he said ""why did you take this connection even if you make it somehow your baggage wont"" - so much for assistance! Even after disembarking last of all we were met by the BA representative at the gate who took us thru the fast track channel and we made it to the flight in a record 20 minutes. All went well except for one tiny hitch one piece of baggage never made it to our next flight."
502,Comfortable seats and plenty of space but the food was poor and the in-flight entertainment system was rubbish. The screens were small and the picture quality terrible. I liked that fact that the cabin crew were more mature people but the service was far from attentive. This is the first time I have flown with BA for over 15 years and I will try and avoid it in future. I have had much better flights with other airlines.
503,Flew to and from Punta Cana from Gatwick. Two good flights. Orderly check-in. Great crew. Food mostly quite good although if a salad is going to comprise a few lettuce leaves and a chopped up tomato frankly don't bother. Flights pretty much on time. Both very busy. Breakfast on arrival in London was poor too. IFE is horrendously behind competitors. Really dire. Ran out of options after about half an hour. Some airlines offer thousands of films and programmes. The crew are the best part of BA as the seats and catering are not up to much. Check in was excellent at both ends. There was a minor system glitch at Punta Cana which meant a short delay but a member off staff came through the queue to keep us all informed. Top notch.
504,We travelled CUN-LGW 11 March and it's the last time we will ever travel Business class with BA. No lounge facilities at Cancun only a voucher offered for use in departure area food outlets. On board usual gymnastics to get in and out of seats ran out of food choices for dinner limited choice for breakfast tea served in a cup without saucer. Cabin staff excessively noisy in galley throughout flight. Better value in cattle class.
505,YYZ-DXB via LHR. Outbound flight YYZ-LHR was delayed by an hour. Good thing they sent a text message well ahead of time. Boarding was quick and efficient in flight entertainment (IFE) was superb with plenty of very good choices latest releases. Probably the best I've seen in Economy class. Service was ok normal. B777 was great - I'm 6ft 4in so I asked for bulkhead seats. I ordered a special meal and it was ready for all four sections of my journey. LHR-DXB portion all good (B747). On the way back DXB-LHR was great (B777) - I took the 3.20pm outbound flight right after my business was completed (as opposed to taking those 1-2am flights that are offered by other air carriers). LHR-YYZ flew on the new Dreamliner 787. I was not too impressed with the seat configuration and space. To me the 777 was more comfortable. All in all I was pleased with BA's service and comfort.
506,Due to a health issue I chose to fly business class from Sydney to Singapore Singapore to Heathrow Heathrow to Mykonos and then returned BA15 6th October. I was seated in the same seat 16k both ways. My main problem was that by the time they got to me for each meal time whatever I had chosen off the menu they had run out of or there had been a mistake and they didn't have the meals that were on the menu. Often I would have to call out to them for a drink as they seemed to forget that there was another seat. In the morning because I am diabetic I had to go to the front and ask for something to eat which was hard as most people where sleeping and I didn't want to disturb anyone.
507,British Airways business class is outclassed by rivals. The lay out of the seats needs sorting - I do not expect people to step over me when I have my seat extended in order to get out of their seating area. The inflight food was poor. Drinks were offered occasionally - 3/4 times on a ten hour flight - slightly warm coffee - ran out of ice. The idea that you have a selection of food to choose from in the business class galley was a joke. Non business class passengers used business class toilet and then helped themselves to the food. Inflight entertainment very poor. The terrace lounge at Gatwick is outdated - no hot food apart from porridge (we checked in at 9.00am) a few pieces of cold toast plus the usual cold meats and cheese. Booking business class with British Airways is definitely not worth the money.
508,"I have to admit to not being a fan of the BA Club World (Business Class) configuration but this is what our travel agent came up with for our direct flight. Seating you head to toe allows them to get in 8 seats across compared to their competitors normal 7. On my flight 11 rows this gave them 11 extra seats good for the bean counters but can cause problems for the passengers. On my flight from MLE to LGW 10 hrs 35 minutes I was in 11B facing forward and in the bed position my feet were on a drop down stool fixed to the back of 10B. The passenger in 10A facing back had to step over my legs to exit their seat and kicked me a number of times as they did this during the long flight. It is illegal to drink alcohol in the airport in Male and so after take off I was looking forward to a cold lager. The drinks trolley came but all the beer including the lager was warm. The FA said that they had no means of cooling the lager on board. I cannot drink warm lager and I am not a spirit drinker and so went without. I settled down to watch a film but my entertainment system would work for about 15 minutes and then shut itself down. No entertainment system and I then found that some of the adjustment buttons on the seat did not appear to be working so it was either sitting up or lying down and risk being kicked. There were 2 meal services on the flight. The first one was OK but when it came to the second one when they got to me last row in the cabin they had run out of food and all they could offer me was a salad. Not the best flight in the world and when we arrived at LGW all the economy bags came off first and the Club bags with ""priority"" tags attached came off last. I have been in correspondence with BA and Customer Relations has stated ""You traveled in the cabin you originally booked. However the meals we serve and our in-flight entertainment system is complimentary and not included in our fare. The BA website has a description of this service which includes: 1) Extensive Flight Entertainment System. 2) Seat Converts to 4 key positions. 3) Choice of light meal or four course dining. BA claimed to be ""The Worlds Favorite Airline"". They are not mine. They also clam ""To Fly To Serve"". Well as they say they did fly me from MLE to LGW bt I am not quite sure where the service came in."
509,Club Europe from LHR to Frankfurt RTN. Outbound flight was great A320 with new seats which are very comfortable great food and a good service. Aircraft on the return leg was a very old A319 rather dirty and quite shabby looking inside however purser working Club Europe was outstanding.
510,Travelled back from Cape Town on 28th February 2015. Booked seats beforehand to make sure that we had front row seats only to get on the plane and discover contrary to what the webview had displayed we were bang smack in the middle of a row of seat! Complained to BA and told that the maps you can see on ba.com are representative of the seats on board flights and that they cannot guarantee your seat will be exactly as shown on our website as the configuration can vary depending on the aircraft you're travelling on. What a total rip off! The seats were extremely cramped our inflight entertainment system keep failing. Once the food had been dished out and tidied away the flight attended disappeared completely and absolutely no water or drinks were offered until we were about two hours from landing! BA need to get their act together and invest in better aircraft's. Clapped out 747s - even first class looked shoddy!
511,LHR-PISA-LHR. I have a house in Tuscany so fly there often. I used to fly a certain yellow/blue/white budget carrier from Stansted but got fed up at being treated like an inconvenience and that the FA's consistently spoke poor English. As a Silver card holder my wife and I enjoyed a nice breakfast in the lounge. It was not busy. We were seated in the exit rows which I selected before we left. It was better than the Club Europe space I had last month - which is why I bought economy as opposed to Club which I feel represents very poor value. The plane was a nice new A320 with the new seats. It was spotless. We had a nice snack on both flights + a few Gin and Tonics for me ! (the wife was driving on arrival) The FAs were great. Friendly and treated us like customers - not like cattle. Funnily enough both flights pushed back early and arrived early. Flight home was a bit rough due to high winds around Pisa - and a re-assuring comment over the PA system was a thoughtful touch to nervous flyers - my wife included. All in all BA at its best. They either getting it right or spectacularly wrong. There never appears to be anything in the middle. Am flying again with them in 4 weeks time and look forward to it.
512,Flew to Bangkok with Thai Airways who were lovely to fly with great choice of food and good leg room. We were expecting at least the same level of comfort and service with BA. The leg room is terrible and only an hour after take off the lady in front put her chair in full recline and made the space in front of me so claustrophobic I couldn't see the TV screen as it was so close to my face as well as having to sit at an awkward position as I have long legs and couldn't put them out in front of me. So uncomfortable. The food was dire with cheap pasta or minuscule fish with more rice After a fortnight of eating rice it would have been nice to have something different. Does BA actually read and take notice of these negative reviews are we wasting our time?
513,My partner and I booked a long weekend break with BA in NYC including flights from Manchester and accommodation - we deliberately selected the BA flight option for the round trip to save having to change terminals at London Heathrow. When I booked us in online 24 hours before travel we discovered that our long haul flights had been changed to American Airlines (5th to 9th March). This meant we had to change terminals T5 to T3 with very little time following our flight from Manchester - even with the priority transfer notes it was a very close call and very stressful - not helped by the fact that we got held up trying to leave T5 due to a closed door! The flight with AA was OK but the food on both the outward and return legs was disgusting and not at all what we expected. The BA web site allowed me to book the arrival transfer but refused to allow me to book the return so I had to organise that myself! I have rated the travel experience Questions 7 & 8 based on the American Airlines flights to and from NYC. The BA flights from Manchester to Heathrow were great. We also struggled with the AA website when trying to check in for our return flights.
514,LGW-TFS-LGW seat pitch and comfort were good. The snack was perfectly adequate but the bar service was diabolical. My husband asked for a beer which was bordering on warm. I asked for a Bacardi and diet coke was advised had run out of Bacardi (bearing in mind we were one of the first to be served). I settled for a white wine which was tepid had to add ice to it. Further into the flight my husband asked for a second beer he was told that they had to save the beers for the return flight. Our crew were all slightly older they were obviously very experienced to the point of doing everything automatically but not actually listening to the passengers. On our return flight we received almost the same service only allowed one can of beer and no Bacardi. Very disappointing we wanted to relax and celebrate our anniversary with an inflight drink. The return crew were slightly more attentive but the good old BA customer service was missing.
515,First time in reduced leg room Club Europe. Don't bother no different to economy both colleague and I sat with legs splayed jammed into seat in front. Save your money fly in the back and spend considerable savings on a better hotel better holiday or whatever. Good crew and food though.
516,LHR-SOF-LHR seat 1A on an upgraded A320 in both directions check in at T5 quick and the galleries lounge was fine as always. Departed on time a breakfast served by a pretty nice crew not that much room really for business class appears to be getting less. Return check in quick although security at Sofia very slow and the lounge is not worth using!! flight delayed around an hour due to weather but once away a decent meal served by yet another nice crew landed around 30 min late on a remote stand but bags on the belt by the time I reached it.
517,"This is not reflective of BA in general only this particular flight. I flew LHR-ABV on Saturday 7th March. This was the Friday 6th flight that had to be rescheduled due to technical issues. Now if anyone is familiar with this route you will know that service onboard is sometimes not as consistent as say the transatlantic routes. Considering that the flight had been delayed 23 hours one would have though that cabin crew would have been more attentive. This is not to say they were in any way unprofessional they were just in a hurry to give you a drink and your meal. There after you barely saw them! Duty Free sped through the cabin faster than Usian Bolt and landing and immigration cards were handed out just before landing. I was part way through completing mine when I heard the ""Cabin Crew 10 minutes to landing"" announcement! The seat I was sat in had a broken IFE screen hinge and would swing back to the closed position. Fortunately the cabin was not full which is a first for this route! Sadly the seat I then chose also had an IFE issue too - a minor one but annoying nonetheless. Third time lucky and hussar! I must add that the choice of films were rather poor too. The food would have been good save what was on the main menu. It was a choice of Chickpea Tagine Chicken and African Stew. Which region of Africa did that stew pertain to be from lord knows. Anyway I opted for the chicken. I must say I was supremely underwhelmed. It was nothing short of a ""school dinner"": flavourless and unappetising."
518,BA085 LHR to YVR 10/03/15. Narrow seats without much legroom food acceptable but nothing special. Upgrade not an option due to restrictions of avios programme. Overall not happy.
519,London to Budapest and back in Club class. First leg not too bad apart from ridiculously narrow seat which is exactly the same as economy seat but a spare one in between. Usually seats are moved so that they are wider with a narrow seat in the middle. The return was terrible. BA do not pay for Cub Europe travellers to use Fast Track at security - disgraceful especially as it is particularly slow and inefficient. The lounge is mediocre at best. Absolutely not worth paying for Club. BA need to get a grip on their falling standards and increased prices.
520,LHR-SOF-LHR 27th Feb/2nd Mar Seat A1 on an A320 in both directions check in at T5 quick used the BA Galleries South lounge which was good as ever. Boarding on time as was departure and arrival new business seats on both aircraft which were comfortable enough. Food (Breakfast) and crew on outbound very good bags waiting once through immigration in Sofia. Return check in quick although security check was so slow the lounge in Sofia is dreadfully dull with no facilities food or drinks passengers would be better of using the general airport facilities! Departure was almost an hour late as was arrival due to weather at Heathrow; otherwise crew were great as was the lunch served.
521,I took a flight from Gatwick to Barcelona. Although it had a BA flight number it was operated by Vueling and that meant I couldn't use the BA lounge despite my silver Executive Club membership. I didn't choose Vueling I was under the impression I had chosen BA and would get the BA perks just the same. There was no in flight entertainment (hence 1/5 - it should be 0 of course).
522,"I travel world-wide mostly on business and in Business Class. I don't think I have ever had a flight with BA that wasn't without an issue. Recently and not for the first time I checked in to find that Club Class had been over sold. So lets call it what it is.. Greed it's a disgusting practice. The planes are usually dirty and if you get ""Bumped"" down to Economy the food is awful while the Cabin crew are mostly helpful and friendly you don't see them apart from meal time even when you use the call button where do they go and what and what are they doing?"
523,I flew from LHR to SIN; the aircraft was a Boeing 747-400 which was tired and old. The IFE had to be re-booted and the system was not yet up to date like on other BA aircraft. The seating cover on my Club World seat kept coming off the aircraft seemed very tired. The food again was at a good standard and the crew were helpful. I always fly BA and I love the Boeing 747 but unfortunately the 747 have to go at some point.
524,Heathrow - Mexico and Cancun - Gatwick in economy. Entertainment fine food ok spacious seats nice crew and excellent landing. I shall fly again with BA.
525,We flew with BA on 6th February to Goa - had three flights in all starting at Manchester. On our outbound journey we were upgraded to Premium Economy which was fantastic! Very comfortable food was much nicer. On our way back we were in economy. As a family of 4 we were split only by an aisle but it is much nicer to all sit together. Our youngest was awfully sick I think as a result of turbulence as well as sleep deprivation. Bless the steward who cleaned it up. However we were sat for 10 hours with the after effects! Nothing anyone could have done however. Staff always very friendly and nothing seems to be any trouble. Would certainly fly again with them but this next time the prices have rocketed. Not as much room in the economy and when seats are reclined there's little room. The passenger in front kept putting her hands over the back of her head rest which then covered my TV screen - I had to keep moving them off. Just one bit of advice for the stewards - make sure during meal times you are vigilant in ensuring that passengers put their seats up!
526,Flew LHR-JFK-LHR in February and enjoyed excellent service on both sectors. I used AVIOS points for these flights and had booked in World Traveller Plus. From the moment I boarded at LHR terminal 5. I was addressed by name throughout the flight. (I have a BA Executive Club Silver Card.) The cabin crew couldn't have been more friendly yet discreet. Offered a glass of champagne extra wine and post dinner drinks. I was given a very warm welcome. On the return from JFK I was surprised and pleased to have been given an upgrade to Club World in spite of travelling on a Reward Flight. This meant I was able to use the pre-flight supper in the JFK lounge which is so much better than eating during the flight so I was able to maximise sleep. I couldn't have been more pleased with the service I received on both legs. When BA gets it right it is in a class of its own; friendly personal yet very unobtrusive service.
527,Recently flew to EZE and back from LHR. Longest flight on the BA network. In each direction the crew were brilliant and nothing was too much trouble. IFE rather dated and choices were only average. Food was ok better than last year on this route. Actually had a very tasty steak out of EZE which was pink great! But full English breakfast is best avoided the continental choice was excellent. On schedule both ways and landed 30 minutes early both ways. Baggage arrived very promptly. For once there were no long queues at EZE. (Buenos Aires). I fly this route perhaps twice a year 3 years ago it was all pretty diabolical but despite cutbacks crew all seem much more friendly and the food is slowly improving. No other direct flights from LHR.
528,"LHR-Washington in Club World. My disappointment continues with BA on the A380 Club World seat. In theory being the flagship plane - it should have the flagship Business class seat. As a regular traveller with BA I know the ""Club"" product well and this seat is a lot more cramped than the older 777 product. What BA risk when they downsize a product is insulting the regular traveller whom WILL notice and take offence and fly with someone else. Its a bit like the BA First product this used to have caviar on the JFK route and silver plated cutlery and Krug champagne. Now they don't. I notice because I used to experience it. Meanwhile prices have shot up - and quality has shot downwards. Very disappointing."
529,Flight was cancelled with no explanation. No offer of help whilst having to stay the 2 extra days in Thailand. My flight from Bangkok to Heathrow was horrendous. Travelled World Traveller plus which is a total waste of money. We were served a meal within the first couple of hours of the 12 hour 35 minute flight. I was offered beef or Fish. It was actually Chicken. Apart from a tub of Ice Cream the next meal was not for another 8/9 hours. When the meal did arrive it was Pasta or Chicken. I asked for chicken. It was Fish! It was also vile. Sent it back. Judging back the food going up and down the aisle so did several others. I went to the back of the cabin for a cup if tea. I was advised if I wanted more tea could I retain the paper cup as they were running out!!! It was like being on some 3rd World airline. This is BA. Supposedly the flagship airline of our country. It's an absolute disgrace. I have flown for over 40 years and never again with BA.
530,Flew from SFO to Milan via Heathrow on 2/14 returned 2/21. Outbound was rescheduled due to changes requested by my company's business partner in Milan. This was the third reschedule and BA charged 433.40 533.90 and 275.00 successively on a basic $1822.00 economy flight. No other airline does this in my experience. Incredibly my travel agency could not reserve me a window seat ahead of time - unless I paid an extra $53.00 for each flight. I did so but was given an aisle seat on the outbound flight anyway. Both overseas legs were on 747s that were extremely cramped for someone over 6 ft. tall. On the way out my antiquated in-flight display did not work. On the way back my headphone jack was broken. We left Heathrow 90 minutes late due to a computer glitch but for the next 12 hours the BA website indicated on time arrival so my wife waited two hours extra at SFO. Overall a very poor experience. I will avoid BA whenever possible.
531,My return flight from Cape Town to Heathrow BA0042 30/1/15 was a miserable experience. My entertainment system was not available for three hours despite being told that it could easily be re-set. (No one was available to do it). When it did become available it was lights-out time and my seat would not recline. It was not possible to focus on the screen with the reclined seat in front at such close quarters. Two stewardesses thought the seat belt was preventing the seat from reclining but when this was not the reason no one else came to investigate. No one seemed to care that I needed to stand for long periods to relieve my back. Being polite and patient did me no good. I have several questions. How often are the seats serviced? Why is the entertainment system so unreliable? How often are the seat belts checked because mine kept slipping? Customer Services want me to chose BA in the future but as they ignored addressing these issues when I wrote to them I have too many doubts.
532,British Airways general onboard services in First are generally acceptable. However the airline refuses to acknowledge that premium ground services should be added for paid First class passengers. Ground services such as special assistance for transfers that are so widely available on other carriers for their First class passengers are sorely lacking at BA (ex. Lufthansa First Class terminal and transfers at FRA and others). Even as a Gold Executive Club top tier member there is nothing available - even when I call and request assistance on long-haul First flights (ex. LHR to HKG) that involve changes in planes between T3 and T5 at LHR. BA needs to wake up and examine the overall First product. The upgrades to the First cabin are also marginal. Packing 14 narrow (even on new A380s) seats in First puts the airline at a huge disadvantage to other OneWorld carriers who have a true First product (ex. Cathay has 8 true suites in First). Wake up BA - your premium fare paying customers are irate over this lack of First product amenities including full ground support (especially upon special request) for paying First passengers.
533,I fly BA business regularly between Delhi and London. I was surprised at how dirty the plane was - on 2 of my last three flights my table was sticky and the area around me stained. The food quality is generally pretty poor - especially on the Delhi to London leg. Also why not get some decent magazines - Country life Decanter the Economist rather than a dull inflight magazine and a grubby copy of Hello! I residually like BA but they have to up their game.
534,Flew BA2043 Gatwick to Male in World Traveller Plus. Plane a Boeing 777 which was very old and thus the entertainment screen was small. The main dissatisfaction was the food - going out it was the worst that we had ever had in long haul and coming back it was not much better. The choices ran out when the cabin crew got to me (comment someone has to be last and unfortunately it is you sir). I finally got my choice when the Captain gave up his first choice! Other airlines particularly middle east and far east based do a much better job.
535,Returning from St Vincent late on LIAT Airways we landed in Barbados at 1750 for the 1755 flight to Gatwick. The BA and Virgin flights to Gatwick were still on the Tarmac. All Virgin passengers were quickly met by a representative and sent through to the flight. BA customers had to fend for themselves and therefore missed the flight. That meant pleading for a seat on the 21.10 hrs flight. Not good customer relations. I should add the supervisor at check in was brilliant though.
536,LGW-AMS on Friday 13th. Flight delayed by almost an hour despite being informed in the lounge that everything was on time reason provided by Captain was late inbound aircraft. (this was my third late running BA flight in as many weeks). No apologies other than the rather matter of fact explanation from the flight deck surly cabin crew who clearly wanted to be somewhere else other than looking after their guests on board. I have two more flights in the coming month with BA rather regretting having booked with this carrier now.
537,Beyond Appalling. Flight delayed by ten minutes departing Rome to LHR. As a result one passenger decided he was going to miss his connection in LHR. He was allowed disembark thus leading to a delay in departure from Rome of over 1 hour 30 minutes. Consequent late arrival to LHR. Missed connecting flight. Abandoned in Heathrow at 10.30 on a Sunday night had to book new flights miss a day work find a hotel for the night. Ground staff of no use whatsoever. Staff totally unhelpful. Taking things to a logical conclusion what was to stop more passengers disembarking before departure thus delaying the flight ad infinitum. Correspondence/ contact with BA has been a joke since.
538,"I have always travelled BA and have recently been upgraded to bronze which I would have thought had a few perks? Wrong! My 15 year old son and I travelled from LHR-NYC on BA but it was a code-share with American Airlines. I couldn't check in online so we stood in the long queue and couldn't book an aisle seat either. BA at the airport apparently couldn't help because it was a code-share even though I had bought through BA! The flight was on time and seats a reasonable size. Coming back we flew from Washington Dulles airport - there was a snow storm and it was freezing. The plane which was an Airbus 380 was supposed to leave at 6.35pm and showing departing ""on time"" not until 6.15 pm on the 21st Feb. Then BA Announced a 20 min delay which sounded reasonable considering the weather outside and all the other planes were delayed or cancelled! We were all boarded on the plane when they announced the plane was too heavy to be pushed out and there was too much snow behind the plane so they called the snow ploughs! We sat on the plane for 6 hours with no food or refreshments except water! There was nowhere for us go apparently so we couldn't get off the plane. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out that with all the snow and a huge airplane that there would be large problems. The final straw was after 5 hrs and the third attempt to move the plane was that we had to sit for another 45 mins defrosting the wings! British Airways were not prepared to cancel or reschedule the flight but instead made us sit like cattle on the airplane. It's a disgrace and we they will probably put it down to bad weather and not negligence bad planning or bad management on their part! Time to look at a new airline to fly with."
539,Heathrow to Washington A380 upper deck club world return. Crew fantastic aircraft clean seats comfy food excellent both ways. Cannot pick fault with anything apart from they advertise 50K as being a window seat when in fact you actually cannot see out of a window from this seat. I think it's time BA invested some money on the Gatwick club world cabins. The Heathrow product is 100 times better but the price difference does not reflect the difference in standard of service and product delivered.
540,Recently travelled to Geneva return in economy from LGW excellent flights on time and very comfortable on board the B737-436 (G-DOCW/G-DOCX). BA provide a nice complimentary breakfast on BA2736 and drinks and snack on the return BA2737 no hesitation to recommend.
541,BA 0058 Cape Town to London Heathrow Seats 03A & 04A. Check in - Directed to Club World check in. One of our bags not labelled with First Priority label. A little annoying as on the way out all First luggage was the very last off the carousel. Boarding was via gate 2 and then through World Traveller Plus section. Again annoying as that happened with boarding and disembarking on the way out. Electrical problems with entertainment and lighting - resolved after two hours. No First amenity bags on board. No sleep suit offered as not on board either. Seat for buddy dining kept collapsing. As it was the 1st of the month new wine list available. After one glass of Mersault there was no more on board. Offered 2 of last months whites as an alternative. Butter at breakfast was rancid. Needn't have worried about the bag without the priority label. It came of before our other bags! Again First luggage came through long after most of the other classes of travel had cleared the baggage hall. We did disembark through door 1 however. Crew pleasant and apologetic. Why do we pay the extra? It's back to Club World for us. Time to start trying other airlines as well.
542,Flew from LAX-LHR on BA's new A380. The crew are rightfully proud of their new aircraft and could not stop telling the passengers about its status. My seat was picked as 53K Upper Deck. I couldn't believe how cramped it was for this long journey. The divider partition was covered in red wine stains from a previous trip and staff seemed nonchalant about cleanliness. The available width of BA's offering is a big disappointment. Whilst those socially awkward individuals might enjoy the clandestine surroundings I for one do not favour the casket-feel of Club World. The A380 and 787 were a chance to hone the business class offering after much criticism. Execution of the flight was prompt and we pushed back on schedule. I fly a lot for work and am privileged to enjoy the premium cabins but poor attention to detail and very slow service don't inspire a return to a specific carrier. One alcoholic drink was offered just after take off and then the all too familiar menu was wheeled out. BA's menu for this flight was identical to a return LHR-MIA-LHR leg I took back in early December. Lacklustre choices and the infamous warm chicken breast salad. Maybe I was tired and didn't endear myself but it needs to be better. I recently flew the A380 with AF to LAX in Business and that was a role reversal! No limp and greasy bacon sandwich on AF either. LAX Teminal B a massive improvement over the years. From fast immigration to pleasant design it's the leader in aspiring all US airports to improve their standards and get rid of carpet underfoot! Although and in summary is this solely enough in a demanding arena where those availing themselves of premium cabin experiences have quite the opposite.
543,"LHR-JFK. End of a One-World RTW trip. What a disappointment. After a mind-numbing trip through Flight Connections (BA to BA) and a 15 minute walk to the last gate on the B concourse only to get on a 12-15 minute bus ride i was escorted to the F/C cabin which reminded me more of a rabbit warren than an airplane. The aisle was so narrow that it was impossible to put my carry-on bag in the overhead over my seat. Very claustrophobic. Seat was strange. Very narrow and difficult to sleep in - at least 6-7"" narrower than the seats on CX or AA. Strange recline mechanism - normally you can adjust the recline and the foot rest separately but not in here. The seat reclines in one motion so you can't ""fine tune"" it like with other airlines. Menu looked fantastic - apps were good salad was nothing special and the main course (Indian style Lamb) was virtually inedible. Cheeses were good desserts and wines OK. EVOD was not to the standards of the competition. Fewer movies and TV selections than either AA or CX. Crew was fine. Stick with AA/CX from now on."
544,Cabin crew polite unfortunately BA ran out of chicken ran out of wine ran out of soft drinks. The food was awful. Inflight service was a disaster - did not work properly. 12 hours 20 mins flight everything counts obviously BA overlooked this. To be fair all cabin crew were polite and accommodating. I will never fly again with BA.
545,My wife and I travelled with our daughter and her 20 month old baby to London. We travelled in First Class. We did the same trip last year but without our daughter and her son. Naturally we were a little bit nervous about travelling with the baby but the staff were so accommodating helpful and friendly that we had nothing to worry about. The staff on both legs were superb in every respect. The food was excellent and the First class sleeping pods were excellent in every respect. Comfortable clean and well appointed. We will travel with British Airways every time we could not fault them in any way. Just one minor thing that is no fault of British Airways. When they call the flight there is a dedicated boarding row for First Class passengers but it seemed that everyone was able to use this lane which means that we had to join the queue rather than just walk straight through. I know that this sounds rather pathetic but surely if one is prepared to pay the additional fare one should be entitled to some form of privileges. We have travelled with British Airways on many occasions and each time we have had the same wonderful experiences.
546,Flew F class on the A380 IAD-LHR-IAD. IAD lounge was charming great bar nice Concorde dining room with good service nice food and on my visit an excellent soup. Greeting staff very nice and bartenders that knew how to do their job. Only the slightest downfall was in the Club Class section of the lounge the finger sandwiches were dry as sand and just as flavorful. Station Manager Captain and Inflight Crew were was kind and generous with their time. Food was decent Champagne was great! IFS was strange and not easy to use but got help from FA's on both flights. Arrival at T5 was shocking. Like a heard of rabid bovine charging for the exits. Shoved like sardines into small trains with nothing to hold onto everyone started to tumble. Processing through fast track however was a breeze. Return. F check in is at the far end of the terminal agent at the counter had the personality of wall paper paste. Concorde Room staff were delightful breakfast was nice Massage was ok. Train to gate not nearly the terror it was on arrival. Boarding for First was a snap FA's top notch food ok. Arrival into IAD was as joyus as surgery with long walks confusing machines little help. Overall after reading so much negative about BA I was at least made to feel special at every stop except check in at T5.
547,On a recent flight from Johannesburg to London I was shocked to find such cramped seating conditions in the World Traveller economy class section. Having not been able to secure an aisle seat (which would have made minimal difference anyway) I was allocated a middle seat of 3. Like many other men (and some women) I am over 6 ft. with long legs so the acute discomfort I experienced was manifest from the start of the flight to the end about 10 hours. It was difficult to stretch my legs and at times I had to stand in my seat to alleviate leg cramp. It also caused me considerable back pain. I did offer to swap seats with a lady in the adjacent aisle seat but she was unwilling to do so that was her prerogative. So it became necessary to disturb her on a number of occasions to take a walk along the aisles in order to alleviate leg cramps. The cabin staff were co-operative in allowing me to use one of their seats in order to stretch my legs but had to return to mine during a period of turbulence. Reading very similar reviews it does make me wonder if British Airways will bother take any notice or continue to treat their passengers (customers) in this appalling fashion. About 10 years ago I experienced an appalling flight from Buenos Aires to London via British Airways (albeit for different reasons) and swore I would never use them again. But I felt I would give them one more chance. What a mistake. The world's favourite airline - don't make me laugh.
548,Heathrow to Boston on what was once called queen of the sky now grandmother of the sky. Went WTP on ancient 747 with tiny monitors with badly scratched screen and awful selection of movies and music. Food just OK but crew very good. Not worth the money better off in economy.
549,The flight was to Dubai we travelled on the 9.45pm outgoing and 3.20pm incoming to Heathrow. We travelled in economy the seats were cramped and hard. It was freezing cold so cold in fact passengers wore coats with a blankets on them as well. The food was awful no choice whatsoever. I asked for a coffee because I was so cold but had to wait an hour and then had to ask again before I received it. The flight attendants on both flights did not look smart appeared to want to perform there duties as quickly as possible without any care for the passengers wishes so that they could stand and chat at back of flight and catch up with each other. We have had better flights on easyjet.
550,LHR-CDG return. The outbound flight was ok. Nothing special as always. The seats are the new fitted seats for European flight. The meal was abysmal compared to AF. The return flight was really annoying. One of the FA was rude. He looked bored and tired as it was the last flight of the day. He showed no interest in collecting the used cups. I know it was a short flight but it was just unacceptable. It's just a shame to see once a great airline is declining like that.
551,Flew AMS-LHR-JFK return 26th Dec - 31st Dec. AMS-LHR-AMS on A321 the first thing you notice is the cabin interior. Although clearly an older bird the new interior has a very comfortable and warm feel to it - yet also modern. Nice and comfy leather seats leg room just sufficient for flight under say 2 hours. Service is as expected a quick drink and some nuts (though a sandwich would be nice on a mid-morning flight). They are clearly matching their product with the competition on this route as free newspapers where available upon boarding contrary to the intercontinental stretch. LHR-JFK-LHR on B744 totally different experience. Transferring through T5 at LHR easy enough although I got the feeling they like to control the passenger flow to the max - but hey this is the UK after all. Also BA advertise T5 as like it's one building - not the case. All this was acceptable until we found out we were being directed to a bus gate. They actually board a fully booked B744 through busses with one stairway and door available for the entire plane. Given all the 788's completely cold and dark occupying the airbridges I felt this was totally unnecessary. Turned out to be a very dated 744 with mostly Club World and First seats as the economy plus and economy consisted of only 2 cabin sections together rest of the plane premium product. How to lose your premium clientele at warp speed. Prime example! Service on board was nice enough food pretty ok and plenty of drinks to choose from. Seats dated and sometimes broken - my adjustable headrest would adjust only to slide back down slowly same problem on both sectors. IFE well just bring your own tablet. So dated it's just not worth switching on. The cabin crew made the difference though on all sectors they were welcoming friendly yet professional and very helpful. Arriving early morning from JFK of course we parked at a hard stand. Waited our turn for 20+ minutes in a non ventilated cabin to get in the bus with only one exit in use. BA this is not acceptable. Disembarking a commuter plane up to 100 pax with buses well ok. But a fully loaded 744? Come on.
552,Out from LHR to JNB on 14th Jan flight BA55 check in poor as we were e-tickets had nothing but passports and destination never had a problem before but was more like a quiz at a pub. Also advised that we would have to pick up our luggage at JNB and check in again at JNB for MUB so we wasted time looking for luggage which was being transferred. We have never liked the premium economy seats on BA but connections in JNB made it necessary to travel BA. Seats have plenty of knee room and general space is good but are far to hard after a couple of hours my backside begins to suffer. Crew were good. As far as airline food goes it was reasonable. Return on BA56 on 29th Jan same problems on seats also toilet nearest to our seats was out of order and without treading on people you have to walk to the end of the aircraft for an alternative also when sitting in premium economy it is not possible to see toilet lights as all are behind you. When possible will always try to use Virgin Atlantic.
553,Flew from LHR to CAI new years day business class - was absolutely superb. Cabin staff were attentive and helpful flight was on time cabin spotless food excellent seats comfortable. My return flight economy again good helpful attendants food was fine seats appropriate and clean. Even though the flight was at a time very high winds were present in UK the landing was skilfully executed and for me as a nervous flyer really I could not have asked for two better flights. I obtained online excellent prices for both flight prices relatively last minute too! No hesitation in flying BA at anytime.
554,LHR-LAX-LHR Economy. Both legs on lower deck of the A380 professional yet friendly service plenty of drink runs between meal services. Seat comfort superior to LH and AF380s. Travelled with an elderly passenger attentive gate staff allowed us to pre-board on both flights. Both flights arrived ahead of schedule. So far best transatlantic experience on an A380.
555,Sydney to Singapore return late Jan/early Feb 2015. The economy seats were relatively comfortable but could be a bit softer. The away leg (BA16) was quite good except for the meal which was barely edible. The flight back had a much improved meal but the entertainment system had repeated issues and had to be restarted about 4 times. Another problem with the return leg (BA15) is that if you get on the plane in Singapore and not in London by the time online check-in is open for you there are almost no seats to choose from. I wanted a window seat and had not a single window to choose from at the moment the online check-in opened for me. Service on both flights was good. I was feeling a bit dehydrated and asked for plenty of water on the return flight and had no problems at all. All the staff was nice and accommodating.
556,"LHR-Zurich. The trip got off to a good start as the North lounge was not to busy and this made the whole experience relaxing rather than an endurance test - which it is when it is busy. Had a nice early light lunch. The aircraft was a new A321. I like this plane. It was rammed end to end. The plane had the new Club Europe seats and it reminded me how well BA seem to be in missing the opportunity to develop a product that could be really high in quality - but isn't. Unless you are seated in row ""1"" - the leg room is appalling and the same as economy. As with the old C.E. seat - the centre seat between 3 seats - is a table. Quite why this is logical escapes me - because it seems to imply that if it suits BA they will at a whim seat three passengers and not two. This was a grand opportunity to stand out from the competition and clearly establish a comfortable - wide C.E. seat. At the same time justify the higher pricing. Its no wonder BA have very few - if any - Travel Industry awards in the services they provide. So frustrating. I had another light lunch and a couple of Gin and Tonics which was nice. The FAs were great. Flight left a few minutes late but we whizzed over to Zurich in 80 minutes which was great. The World's favourite airline? Try ""The Worlds most frustrating airline!"""
557,I flew club world from JHB to LHR on 21/01 on the 747. The flight experience overall was a good one. Sitting on the upper deck of 747 is definitely a must as its a fair bit quieter than the main deck. The check in was a breeze and the staff at the desk were very friendly especially considering I was travelling with loads of luggage bicycle etc. I didn't use the lounge as I know the one in JNB is not very good. The boarding took place on time and we were offered pre takeoff drinks soon after seating. Take off was a bit delayed but smooth non the less. The food leaves a lot to be desired on BA I had the Salmon main course which was very bland. The up side the champagne was perfectly chilled and the desert was yummy. The seat configuration is not the best as you are facing your neighbour. The seat in the lounging position is very comfy but is a bit narrow for sleeping it's also a bit short for taller individuals such as myself. Arrival at T5 was very smooth as I used the fast track lane from landing to climbing in the taxi was less than 30 min. I would definitely fly BA again but they do need to look into the quality of food and the seat configurations for future upgrades.
558,"I have been a loyal customer for the last 10 years and have progressively seen the service cleanliness and interest in client satisfaction decline. I just came back from a NYC-LHR-Dubai trip and will not fly BA again. Several reasons: my seat in Business Class was noticeably filthy - crumbs on the seat and hair on my pillow. When I told the attendant she just fluffed the pillow and walked away. I was hounded for not filling out the breakfast form in 5 minutes (the plane had not even taken off) and told that ""I would not get breakfast"". I was served raw chicken and when I expressed interest in another dish was told that all the other passengers had eaten and that there were no more dishes on the plane? The dish was taken away but no follow up or apologies - not even an extra bag of nuts to ensure that I was not hungry for the 7.5 hr flight. Perhaps the most disturbing part of traveling with BA is that the staff are unapologetically arrogant disinterested and unapproachable and any response is as if they are doing you a favor. As a customer paying nearly 10000 USD for a round trip ticket I shouldn't be afraid to speak to staff and highlight a dirty seat or food that is not cooked. The seats on two of the legs were broken and my screen did not work on three of the legs. There are plenty of other first class carriers out there that I will now become a customer of."
559,My wife and I flew business class LHR-HKG 23/1/15 on a 777-200 seats 11 E&F. Check-in was ok once it got started this took several minutes as the woman at the counter was chatting with 2 friends. The lounge was good overall if a bit crowded and over heated. There was snack type offerings until 6.30pm when hot food was supplied This was very well cooked and presented the Thai green curry was excellent so compliments to the chef. Boarding was on time and efficient unlike our previous BA experience at HKG. We found the middle seats on this plane a bit cramped but comfortable for sleeping. The inflight food was very good I had a chicken and rice dish my wife had braised beef which she says was excellent I do think dessert and cheese should be offered. Unlike our last BA flight 5 weeks ago the crew on this flight were excellent friendly and attentive. The IFE selection is fair but the screen is square and is small compared to that on the A380 (and very small compared to CX). Thanks to the FA's we had a very enjoyable trip. We would fly BA again but only if the price was very competitive the staffing inconsistencies worry me some what this is really a management issue and should be addressed if it were the BA brand would be more competitive.
560,LGW-ACF-LGW (Club Europe) On both flights we had very good cabin staff infact the purser was the same on both flights and he was very efficient and very friendly as were both stewardesses. The food was very good too lovely and hot large portions of chicken/beef tasty liked the choices given so we were very happy. The new seat configuration on the Airbus we did not like we were in row 8 then 6 and they were fine but I'd not like to be in the first row right by the door and noticeably colder (stood right by the row queuing for the loo) and there is no bulkhead any more so it's a very small open space between the first row of seats the loo and the galley! I'm only 5 ft 2 tall and very slim build and I found the loo cramped looking around I couldn't see how 1/3 of the passengers would fit in it and I don't mean they were all way overweight it is very small and slanting roof. A tall and big built person would not be happy! I gave inflight entertainment 1 as obviously they don't exist on short haul flights. The seats were far too upright and therefore uncomfortable you could only recline them a bit or otherwise the poor person behind you wouldn't have had any space and I kept sliding forward on mine. The leg rest has gone too so I had nothing to stop me moving forward and the space between rows felt a lot reduced.
561,Miami to Heathrow on 23rd January 2015. Very old 747 with old style interior in economy. A real disappointment after a series of long haul flights in the new cabin. This really needs replaced. Anyone who has not flown with BA before would leave with a terrible impression. Seats worn cramped and many falling apart with outdated IFE. Food and drinks service usual good standard though. Please BA get rid of this old interior once and for all. It really lets your airline down and does nothing for the passenger experience.
562,We travelled BA in Business class LHR to Vegas before Xmas and returned to LHR from San Diego in January. Business Class travel is a rare treat for us and I can't understand why BA persevere with this unique forwards/backwards facing seating layout. To sit for 11 hours face to face with a stranger is awful as is the lack of space created by the curved partition between the seats. The cabin crew were great food was below average and the inflight entertainment system abysmal: poor choice and terrible picture quality. Outbound we were upstairs on a 747 there were two attendants assisting only 16 passengers and they did a good job and kept the two toilets clean. Given these circumstances this flight experience should have been fantastic. However given the negatives detailed above I would classify it as just about average. We returned on a 777 and my negative feelings are sadly the same other than we were stuck on the plane for 40 mins on landing awaiting buses to disembark.
563,Flew Business Class DEN-LHR-AUH-MCT-LHR-DEN. Flight crew excellent as always. Food was pretty decent for airplane food. Seat was comfortable and certainly better than sitting in the back of the plane. However we think this configuration is a failed experiment by BA. Eight seats across is too many for Business Class. The seats were too narrow. The backward facing seats are disconcerting for two reasons: If you are traveling with a spouse or friend and neither likes to face backwards you can't sit together. Secondly when the divider is down you stare at a stranger 15 inches away. Hope BA reverts to the old style one day.
564,"Flew back from Milan LIN on Jan 4th. Because of ""mist"" (the pilot's actual characterization) most flights that morning had been delayed/canceled in/out of LHR. No delay info given at check-in nor at gate. Upon boarding the captain informed us that because of ""mist"" we were being held on the ground for 2 hours. My connecting flight to SFO was 2.5 hrs after landing in LHR. Flight attendant assured me most flights were being delayed therefore mine to SFO most likely too. Upon landing in LHR a sea of canceled/delayed lost souls. I was immediately told I was forced to miss my connection because my flight to SFO was on time. I was forced to join the longest line I've ever seen for rebooking. It never moved. We were told another set of rebooking desks were available upstairs ""and faster"". Crossing the border control took just as long. Upstairs it took me 5 hours just to get closer to the desks but still at least a couple hours away. I finally managed to join the free wifi and call BA's office to get rebooked online. I was rebooked on a flight from SFO to LHR. The wrong way around. When I pointed out the obvious the agent told me there was a ""computer glitch"" and promised to call me back. She finally called me back and got rebooked on AA flights to JFK and to SFO from there. The next morning at the AA check in they could not check me in on the JFK-SFO because of ""issues with the BA ticket"". It took 90 minutes and multiple interactions with 3 different desks to get it solved. I nearly missed the flight to JFK too. My suitcase was never loaded on that flight and I didn't get it at JFK. It took me 5 days to get my suitcase back. I will never fly British Airways again."
565,Flew LHR-MIA in WT+. Seats 13E and 13F on 747. It was very comfortable for a day flight and after a light meal I managed to get around 5 hours of sleep. Recline is good and leg room ok for a person of my height 5ft 10in. Food was ok and would have liked to eat my partners sticky toffee pudding because mine went down too well! We were off the plane first at MIA before First and club which was rather nifty. Good experience.
566,Return flight from LHR T5 to Washington Dulles (IAD) in Club World. Check in was fine even if the layout of the T5 check-in area isn't the most intuitive. Security was efficient. However the BA lounge was overcrowded and noisy with minimal service and only basic comforts. Outbound flight on the A380. Boarding was rather chaotic due to the gate area being too small for such a large passenger compliment but the flight did push back on-time. The Club World cabin on the upper deck could best be described as grey and functional. It was reasonably clean if not spotless but despite being a relatively new aircraft it did feel slightly shabby already. The Club World seat which was forward facing and on the aisle was comfortable enough. The entertainment screen was rather small and the choice of movies wasn't terribly extensive but everything apart from the in-seat USB power socket was working. The general layout of the cabin was terrible. Not only do window seat and middle row passengers have to step over the legs of aisle seat passengers to get to and from their seats but when the privacy screen between seats is lowered for take-off landing and during meal services you find yourself staring rather disconcertingly close up into your neighbours face. It makes everything feel cramped and cheap. Meals were fine and the crew were polite and efficient. Overall I'd rate the outbound experience as 'Okay' for a business class flight. Return flight experience was far from okay. My flight departing IAD at 10.20 pm was cancelled 6 hours prior to departure due to mechanical issues. Told that there were no Club World seats on the earlier flight out of IAD that night which I could just about make at a push and I would have to fly back in Economy. When I asked about the BA flight from Baltimore (BWI) an hour later I was told that yes there were Club World seats available that evening so I asked to be rebooked onto that flight instead. Arriving at BWI check-in I was informed that unfortunately there actually weren't any Club World seats available and I would have to fly back in World Traveller Plus. The flight from BWI to LHR T5 was on a rather old 767. The cabin interior was dated shabby and cramped with minimal overhead luggage storage. World Traveller Plus seats were cramped and uncomfortable with tiny entertainment screens. In-flight food was bland. The crew were efficient but not terribly friendly. Flight left and arrived on time. As a UK passport holder Immigration at T5 was quick. Baggage reclaim took longer but bags arrived within five minutes of reaching the baggage hall.
567,MAD-LHR-JED club world 777-200. The overall product still good but need some update on aircraft and seat desing. Sometimes the window seat can fell a bit narrow with no extra space for your personals. On the other hand good service fast connection at LHR great lounge FA nice and attentive. IFE good choice of movies nice food (not great). Will fly them again.
568,Flew SYD-SIN-SYD and all in all can't complain. Service was excellent food excellent large wine choice. Seats weren't much different to other Business class seats we have experienced although I would suggest that couples don't choose window seats as they need to actually stand up and walk around to speak to their partner. Seats in centre are adjoining with a sliding screen between. Qantas first class lounge in Sydney was fantastic with full restaurant service. Singapore lounge very comfortable with plenty of seats. Would definitely fly BA again.
569,"Flew MIA-LHR in First. Seats 5a and 5k. This was my first time in BA first and I was really impressed. From the moment my boyfriend and I walked up to check in to the moment we left the plane we were very well looked after. The food was nice and particularly enjoyed the ""buddy dining"". My gooseberry crumble went down well. I got around 2 hours sleep as the jet stream and storm that was hitting the North Eastern U.S made our flight very bumpy but also super fast. Flying time being little over 7 hours 20 mins. I must mention the cabin crew who were very helpful and professional. We bought the seats in the sale and it was money well spent."
570,Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) in Club World. January 2015. Have not flown out of the Tom Bradley International Terminal at LAX for years but it's now much improved. Check in and bag drop a breeze as was security and in the oneworld lounge in minutes. Good choice of food and drinks and plenty of space. Short-ish walk to the gate good welcome on board and drinks served quickly. Couldn't fault any aspect of the experience and we took off and landed on time and managed a good five hours sleep out of the ten hours duration. Love the Arrivals Lounge at LHR. A civilising shower and 2nd breakfast sets you up for the day.
571,"Took a return trip to Dublin over Christmas and found BA to be extremely disappointing. My principal complaint is the dirt - the seats and floor area looked as if they had not been cleaned for many flights. Also at 5'8"" I am not that tall but still found the seats cramped and uncomfortable."
572,Travelled Business A380 LHR-HK and returned on 777 BKK-LHR. Found T5 lounge great as usual seats were fine slept ok in the cabin. Food onboard was tasty and cabin crew professional but friendly. Wash bag was poor for Business but hey it's not a deal braker. IFE was ok touchscreen on both flights.
573,NCL-LHR-NCL. First flight to LHR was great with an informative Captain and friendly efficient staff on a refurbished A320. Cabin is really smart. Arrived into LHR early which is a pleasant change despite the enforced 'stacking' that happens to flights landing at Heathrow. Return flight was great too due to the Captain and crew great service on a full flight however the A319 cabin was the old type and boy did it show! Overall a good experience with BA.
574,My wife and I flew to Barbados late November I had pre booked seats online to and fro but on both occasions the seats were already occupied when we boarded the flight attendants attitude towards this matter on the return journey was at best rude unhelpful and indifferent. Asking for a drink was a complete siege after 2 hours into the flight they claim that they had run out of galley drink supplies. On our return trying to obtain a refund for the pre booked seats proved difficult. Overall B.A. has got to rank as one of the worst airlines to travel with staff with generally poor and indifferent attitudes penny pinching which is bordering on mean and poor legroom. Sad to say this B.A but Emirates and other airlines put our national airline to absolute shame.
575,Flew BKK-LHR was fearing the worst having read the reviews on here regarding the aisle seats where people have to step over you to get out. Relieved to say this didn't cause me any problems and I wasn't disturbed. Found the seat to be comfortable in both the upright and flat bed positions. Service from the cabin crew was adequately good. Food average. Entertainment system average.
576,"LHR-SIN on A380. First Class Seat 1K. Crew unprofessional most of the time forgot seat 1K existed with no welcome drink until 15 mins had passed no water top up until I asked (3 times) forgot wine match with first course and everything handed out with ""ok?"" as a comment. New tasting menu was very good. Had a flight in business with CX a few days later and the food quality crew and overall service was another league - far outshone BA. The BA First product is a waste of money and crew need a re-train."
577,London Gatwick to Mauritius 27th December return 7th January. 777 Aircraft economy class. I never travel economy class so it was a bit of an eye opener particularly on a 12 hour flight. The seats are far too close together and quite uncomfortable. In the middle seat the drop down tray was broken. When the passenger in front put his seat back I couldn't use the tray and when I asked the stewardess to ask him to put it forward a bit she just shrugged and said nothing. Poor unfriendly service and absolute rubbish food. BA are miles behind the Far and Middle East airlines and still charging more. I have no idea why people use them.
578,Bangkok to London Heathrow. 8 Sep 2014. On this flight British Airways stinted on everything. I don't mind a frugal airline as long as the fare is cheap. British Airways is not cheap. As soon as we were in the air the temperature plummeted. Everyone had their airline blankets over them. There were not enough stewards/stewardesses. Forty minutes before the welcome on board drink - and no small snack not even a small packet of nuts. Seatback TV did not work in the section I was on and the man next to me had to move to another seat. The seatbacks should be checked before the flight. However eventually they did work. A small number of films TV shows I have never heard of and no games option. First meal very frugal second meal no salad and no bread roll. And creamers! Even for tea! Whatever the quality of the meal serving creamers cancels out any pretence of quality. Snacks we had to wait and when they were available there was a limited amount. British Airways even ran out of beer! BA hasa system of paying to book a certain seat they don't miss a trick! I resent having to pay to book a certain seat. The flight was expensive but it had a good time slot and no stopover. Never again.
579,"BA191 19th Jan London Heathrow to Austin. Legroom in economy is too small. I'm 6'2"" and just don't fit. On a long haul flight recently I sat with my knees sticking out into the aisle and adjacent seat space for 10 hours."
580,I returned from JFK last Friday morning reasonable flight although delayed for an hour and a half. Main meal was okay but the breakfast was appalling a stale croissant with some jam. I paid good money for this flight. Really disappointed quality is slipping away.
581,DUB-LCY (BA 4467) got the flight on sale for a pretty good price. Great legroom on the E190 and comfortable seats quick and hassle free boarding. Service was a bit slow but included a drink and a snack (enough for such a short flight of an hour) with the option for more if so desired. Would recommend. LCY is going to be my airport of choice when going to London in future was sitting on the DLR 15 mins after landing and at my hotel 40 mins after disembarking and the trip on public transport was only £4.80 rather the excessive cost/time from other airports in the area.
582,CPT-JNB-LHR. Excellent SLOW lounge at CPT with outstanding food and 'loos with a view'. Reasonable flight to JNB although 737 pretty tatty. BA Galleries lounge at JNB not a patch on SLOW lounge. 2/2 layout on 747 upper deck felt superior to 2/3/2 on A380 outward flight particularly as less than 50% full. FAs pleasant and food service managed well. Food better than usual. IFE not as good as Emirates and screen inferior to Club World on A380. Flat- bed seats okay although narrow and hard.
583,Delhi to London in seat 2A 747 aircraft. Very little difference between First and Business in comfort terms and the food was disgusting. Poor choice of entertainment. Only good thing I can remember was a nice white Burgundy but it was probably served in economy too. Will stick to business class in future for the airport fast tracking and lounges.
584,Flying from LGW to MCO on a 772. Compared to last year the cabin was clean. Wide variety of food and beverages. Quality was good. BA is far behind a lot of airlines in business class. The seat is small if you are over 6 feet tall. Staff ok. They don't go out of their way. It seems that they are just doing their job. You don't see them between meals. They need to step up their game. I don't think BA is a 4 star airline. I would only recommend because of direct flight.
585,London-Gatwick to Venice on 30 December 2014 everything went smoothly at check in no problems flight arrived safely. Info given during flight. No gluten free option given for snack during flight but got vegetarian option. Opted for a drink and own snack which I always have as stand by. Cabin crew seemed rushed but polite.
586,San Diego-LHR-MAN. On 6th January we flew from San Diego to Manchester UK via Heathrow. After flying out on Christmas Day via LAX on the A380 this flight was a welcome return to form for BA's Club World offering. The San Diego Admiral's Club lounge is currently undergoing refurbishment but is still a nice space and unlike the UK lounges upon arrival we were offered a menu not just a 'self serve' buffet. When it came time to board this was a much smoother experience than our previous flight on the A380 the staff at San Diego had the boarding area well organised and once club passengers were called we were on the aircraft glass of bubbly in hand in minutes. The cabin crew were much friendlier and professional than those on the outward flight as this is smaller cabin with fewer passengers you definitely felt that you were the 'premium' customer your ticket price would suggest and nothing was too much trouble. Drinks were constantly topped up food was excellent and the cabin crew were chatty and friendly. The entertainment system might not have been quite as impressive as on the A380 but considering we slept for a large portion of this 10 hour flight that was unimportant. After a very average outward flight on the A380 into LA this superb flight home on the smaller aircraft restored my faith in BA's club offering and means that for future trips to the West Coast we will be flying direct into San Diego rather than LAX.
587,Flew MEX-LHR-TLS with BA and was very surprised having seen some negative feedback on here. Flight departed on time we were received well by staff at check-in and had no problems leaving MEX. Aircraft a 747 which was old yet fairly clean. Entertainment system was a little dated but once they got it working provided light relief. Service was very good staff were attentive whilst not overwhelming which is important on a night flight: we were not disturbed but knew refreshments could be brought when requested. Terminal 5 was easy to navigate and flight to TLS left almost on time. Uneventful second flight but nevertheless a good experience. Overall good service and communicative staff dated aircraft and equipment. Would definitely recommend service far better than other transatlantic airlines I have experienced.
588,Just back from a fantastic 2.5 week trip to Thailand flying to and from Bangkok with BA on 777 aircraft. I definitely would choose another airline next time. We flew out on 31st December 2014 and the crew were surly and inattentive. Asking for a drink seemed as if it was really putting them out. One of the crew swore when communicating with her colleague during the drinks service within ear shot of us. Outbound they run out of the the meal choice for both very small meals by the time they reached us so we had to had the veggie option. For most of the flight the crew were camped in the galley at the back seemingly having a party with colleagues whether working or not so you felt it was a imposition to ask for water or snacks. My inflight entertainment system had streaks all across which couldn't be rubbed off making the movies very hard to see. Return flight crew on 16th Jan were much less surly but again conspicuous by their absence meaning you had to try and wade through the party at the back to try and get water or snacks during the flight. Two passengers were flicking raisins about the cabin onto other passengers which might have been spotted had the cabin crew had more of a presence. The inflight entertainment system had major issues which meant it didn't work on demand making it hard to plan viewing of movies. Again 2 very small meals at the either end of a 13 hr flight with very limited options for snacks in between. One staff member said they had very little left then allowed a passenger to grab about 5 packets for herself. Tray table was broken in seat 27b also. The crew said as it was an early flight they knew we all wanted to sleep but the flight left just before midday so not what I call a night flight. I used to love flying BA as have always been impressed with their service in the past but now the planes and the crew seem tired and I am sorry to say neither my partner or I enjoyed the experience. Will look to EVA Thai or one of the Middle Eastern airlines next time.
589,BA 870 22nd Dec 2014. Flew from London to Budapest. Very satisfied with service staff friendly and professional. Even though this was a fairly short trip food and beverages were very satisfactory. Will definitely recommend this airline.
590,I have used British Airways over a number of years for work and leisure trips non-exclusively and must say I have noted a gradual but continued decrease in service quality. On a recent return flight from Johannesburg travelling with an infant we were delayed for over 30 hours. The way in which the delay was handled was terrible. Minimal staff meant it took three plus hours to get checked in to a hotel. Then trying to arrange the return minimising waiting time for the little one took 5 hours with two staff serving 400 passengers with no concern for customers. Tried calling head office and they were less helpful than the booking agents.My intention is to avoid where possible and in many cases they are cheaper alternatives.
591,LHR - Helsinki in Business Class. I happened to fly on this flight as I booked a flight to Shanghai with Finnair in business and BA are a Oneworld partner. Although the cabin crew were very attentive I feel that Club Europe is not worth the extra money considering the length of flight and extra services provided. The aircraft was a brand new A320 with leather seats but there was no extra legroom in the Club Europe section. The seats were the same as in the economy section the only difference being that the middle seat is not in use. There is a movable partition separating the two cabins presumably to offer maximum flexibility for the airline. Hot towels were provided before takeoff but no welcome drinks. The generous bar service started shortly after take off followed by a rather disappointing meal. Considering that it was a 2.5h lunchtime flight all that was on offer was a cold meat platter with a salad and a bread roll. I have had better service in Economy on BA short hall flights in the late 90s. Furthermore I recently flew on a China Eastern Airlines domestic flight of similar length on business class on a new A320 and the seats were in a 4-abreast configuration with much more legroom and I was served with a hot meal! There was no personal entertainment - the overhead screens showed the moving map for the duration of the flight. I do like BA but if you are flying short hall and are considering Club Europe I suggest saving your money and flying in the economy cabin. These low ratings reflect my expectations of business class and not the airline overall.
592,MAN-LHR-LAX. Flew Manchester to LAX via Heathrow on Christmas day in Club World on the A380. Check in and boarding were extremely smooth at Manchester and the lounge was also quiet due to the fact it was a holiday.Upon arrival LHR was much busier so much so that we struggled to find a seat in the south lounge. When it came time to board the aircraft it was quite frankly carnage. There didn't seem to be any real system and we had to fight through the crowds just to be able to get in the (long) line for Club passengers. The downside of such a big aircraft is the number of passengers even in Club world. Once on board it was a fairly standard offering Club World on BA is pretty consistent across all aircraft I now find. Seat and service were all fine not exceptional but acceptable. My one main gripe us that we were seated on the lower deck (seats 13A and 13B) and on our side of the plane there was only one tiny bathroom which often led to a line. The other side of the aircraft had two bathrooms but getting to them meant going all the way round the galley kitchen and cabin staff in there were often busy working or just hanging out and it seemed that they weren't too keen on being disturbed. Whilst there's no doubt the A380 is a quieter aircraft I feel its size and the number of passengers takes something away from the level of service which you'd expect to be high given the price paid for Club World tickets.
593,Regularly travel from BCN to LHR. In addition to booting us out of T5 making international connection more difficult it is now using the newly refurb'd A320s on this route. The ones where BA sneaks another row of seats in between 1 and 10. Already faced with overpriced flights its now insisting on make journeys less comfortable. Less costs more.
594,Flew Miami to Heathrow it was a nightmare the attendant watched me struggle with 2 small cabin cases and did not offer to help and another passenger had to put them in the hold for me while the attendant stood there and watched. It was very clear that he could not be bothered. When the meals were being served he said to myself and my husband (do you want anything as if he was doing us a favour) we asked for nothing the whole of the trip. When arriving in Heathrow yet again he stood and watched me struggling to get the cases down as my husband only has one arm and could not help me. I have travelled many times with BA and always found the staff very attentive but sadly not on this occasion.
595,BA on LCY to DUB in December flight almost full but cabin crew attentive and all smiling and offered a choice of popcorn or chips. Good value considering other airlines on this route does not serve complimentary snack at all.
596,BA284 Dec 29 2014. SFO-LHR First. Great flight with seat 1K at the nose of the jumbo. Cabin was half full so service was professional friendly and efficient. Felt very much taken care of throughout the 10 hour flight. Cabin looked good and seat was comfortable especially in bed mode. The SFO lounge needs some work as not really first class more business The entertainment could be a little better in selection and screen quality. Overall a really good product with exceptional service which BA is known for in First.
597,Return trip (LHR to JFK) in Business class. Excellent trip. We were celebrating my wife's birthday on the way out and the staff were outstanding. Professional attentive but also able to have a laugh with customers. The food was excellent and the wine selection very good as well. Lounge at Heathrow was also very good (T5 is a pleasure to use). Return (overnight) flight also very good - efficient staff and seats comfortable enough to get some sleep.
598,"My wife and I travelled from Manchester to Las Vegas via Heathrow. The flight from Manchester was delayed and then on arrival at LHR the boarding passes which were fine at MAN were no good at LHR. We had to queue for over 2 hours to get more printed. Others with the same problem missed their main flights! The staff at LHR are rude jobsworth who take great pleasure in causing the maximum discomfort. The 747 seats on the LHR to LV flights were terrible like small deck chairs. Any leg/knee movement from the person behind was felt even with the pillow between me and the seat back. Compared with US Air the seats are much smaller and far more basic. Seating totally unsuitable for long haul flights. The entire cabin is extremely cramped the aisles are so narrow that anyone who is not slim tends to bang into your seat every time they pass. BA brought a whole new meaning to ""cattle class"" The cabin staff were efficient and professional the food was fine. I am not a large person certainly not overweight but I was badly cramped. I would never choose BA for a long haul flight again. We travel from Manchester to Las Vegas 2 or 3 times a year. BA is by far the worst carrier we have flown with especially when you add in the extra costs for seat selection etc. Very Poor!"
599,"LGW-CUN Club World seat 4A. To be honest I wasn't looking forward to this flight as it was one of BA's so called ""Leisure Flights"". However I was pleasantly surprised at the high level of service quality of food and wine and friendliness of the crew. Seat 4A is recommended as you don't have to step over anyone to access the aisle. I was first on the plane and first off it just a pity my bags were not the first to arrive."
