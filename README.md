# British Airways Reviews Analysis

## 📝 Introduction
British Airways (BA) is the leading airline in the United Kingdom (UK). Every day, thousands of BA flights arrive and depart from the country, transporting customers around the world. Whether for holidays, work, or other reasons, managing the entire process — from scheduling, planning, boarding, fueling, transporting, and landing to the continuous operation of flights — requires efficiency, punctuality, and first-class customer service. It is a complex task that involves multiple critical responsibilities.
